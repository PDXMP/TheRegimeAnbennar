 S98_oppression_kaino_title:0 "Oppression of the Kaino"
 S98_oppression_kaino_desc:0 "The Kaino people have long been oppressed by the other inhabitants of Fangaula. Long ago they transgressed holy bounds and supported the evil lich they were subsequently named after. Ever since, they have been exiled to the depths of the Dao Nako jungle, lands we once called our own. However, where the rest of the Fangaulan people see a people to be shunned and oppressed, we see potential allies. In a land where we are outnumbered, the Kaino people provide a much needed source of support against the rest of the Fangaulan peoples."

 S98_adventure_begins_title:0 "The Adventure Begins"
 S98_adventure_begins_desc:0 "We have returned to our ancestral homeland. Some to seek fortune, some to seek fame, and others have arrived at the behest of our overlords in Rayafo. Regardless of why we are here, we all share the same goals. Land and fortune… glory and adventure. To claim these prizes, we must fight those who drove our ancestors out of this land. We must fight the beasts that haunt the jungle. We must rule once more!"

 S98_southern_tower_title:0 "The Southern Tower"
 S98_southern_tower_desc:0 "The Halflings of Tiboktsamo are a haughty and proud people. The last remaining clan of our kind that did not flee to Fahvanosy, the Tiboktsamo people have grown hateful of Halfling and Human alike in their isolation. Refusing to treat with us and bent on conquest, these former brothers and sisters are now a thorn in the side of all their neighbors. Additionally, they occupy a strategically important island. It is therefore time we bestow upon them the gift of rightful rulership and replace their wardens with true heroes."

 S98_reclaiming_the_throne_title:0 "Reclaiming the Throne"
 S98_reclaiming_the_throne_desc:0 "When the crown of Rayafo sent us to the mainland to reclaim our past glory, they assumed we would hand over all of our conquests to them. However, we have grown too strong, too proud and too rich to hand over our hard-won spoils to bureaucrats who did nothing but sit in their halls on their safe little island while we bled and suffered. We shall instead use our newfound strength to force them to bend their knees to us. It is no longer our path to serve a distant crown on an island, but their duty to serve the reclamation of our ancestral homeland."

 S98_freeing_the_ananoma_title:0 "Freeing the Ananoma"
 S98_freeing_the_ananoma_desc:0 "The Ananoma, ancient beehive-shaped fortresses built by our ancestors on the mainland, dot the shores of Southern Sarhal. These once proud structures have fallen into disrepair, but they can be reclaimed and fortified again. One such Ananoma is located just to the east of our land, in the great city of Kunolo. Now ruled by humans, Kunolo's great trading port and the Ananoma within must be put under our control if we eventually seek to hold southern Sarhal in our grasp."

 S98_refocusing_the_homeland_title:0 "Recruiting the Homeland"
 S98_refocusing_the_homeland_desc:0 "In Fahvanosy they dream of reclaiming the mainland, but we were the only Halflings brave enough to set out and attempt it. Now we must entice our island-bound brethren, previously focused on trade and frivolity, to direct their efforts towards this glorious quest. The years of settled life in Fahvanosy may have brought them riches, but we need to redirect the minds of our brothers and sisters towards our true goal."

 S98_the_hydra_title:0 "The Hydra"
 S98_the_hydra_desc:0 ""A hundred heads! Fifty tails… All bigger than the last!"\n\n"Radama, get your mind straight, five, six heads at most. 'Twas a big creature, just like the ones in the painting of old king Ravaka in the capital hall."\n\n"Aye, just like that, but bigger, scarier, stronger!"\n\n"…Anyways, it was a hydra. Just outside the first Ananoma to the west. I reckon our fancy, new Monster Hunters can handle it." - Radama and Zalifa, Husband and Wife and Co-Owners of the Sira Bamdivy"

 S98_ninki_nanka_title:0 "The Ninki Nanka"
 S98_ninki_nanka_desc:0 ""We made our way inland after anchoring our dinghy beside the delta of the river's mouth. Even from this distant vantage point, the beauty of the jungle was immense. Greens and blues interrupted with shocks of bright red, the flapping of bird wings larger than any we knew in our home isles. The Ananoma jutted from the canopy some distance north, bidding us to seek it out. We set out immediately."\n\n"Strange tidal patterns have harried our trek. While crossing the gently flowing river, the waters rose as if compelled by the gods themselves. Several pack mules were swallowed whole. We must remain careful near the river."\n\n"Not many survived. First the impossible flood drowned many, then the beast revealed itself. Massive and many teethed, the serpent… though I remember limbs… flailed its massive length upon us. Our strongest sailors were shattered as if they were brittle flotsam crashing upon rocks in a storm. The beauty of the jungle was but an illusion, for now all I see is death." - Journal of Azaly Seagaze, Captain of the Kibo Feno"

 S98_wereleopards_title:0 "Wereleopards"
 S98_wereleopards_desc:0 "“T'was a man… with a tail! Well, he grew the tail, see. At first, just a man, a big man. Then he's changing 'fore me eyes. Gettin' bigger, hairier, spottier, like a leopard… a leopard-man, a man-leopard, whatever you want to call it. All I know is he leapt atop a building and flew away. Well, maybe he just jumped. But anyhow, 'twas the strangest thing I ever did see.” - Haingo, Local Drunkard"

 S98_asanbosam_title:0 "Asanbosam"
 S98_asanbosam_desc:0 "“Guardians of the Jungle, they claim to be\n\n yet evil they spread throughout the trees.\n\nWith scythes of ironwood upon their feet\n\n the souls of the lost are what they reap\n\nStrong of limb and silent as breath\n\nthe Asanbosam will bring your death.” \n\n- Local Kaino Children's Song"

 S98_ghosts_of_past_title:0 "Ghosts of our Past"
 S98_ghosts_of_past_desc:0 ""Looked just like you, but hairier. And with an odd black shining axe. Regardless, slaughtered my flock, he did. So check your people for a crazed man traipsing about in a loincloth and shells in his beard.” - Constabulary Report no. 1556, Missing Livestock from Human-owned Ranch\n\n\n"Of interest are the so-called Ghost Halflings. Said to be Halflings who did not leave the Dao Nako with the rest of the Vyzemby, these illusive people are so rarely seen that most believe them to be only a tall tale. While no concrete proof of their existence has surfaced, they warrant more study as Lencenori trade relations with the peoples of the Dao Nako strengthen." - A Treatise on Sarhaly Trade Prospects, Florien síl Wineport"

 S98_the_kaino_title:0 "The Kaino"
 S98_the_kaino_desc:0 "Our Kaino allies have proven very useful in administering the Dao Nako areas we have taken. Now it is time we expand their reach and bring other Kaino from different tribes into our fold. There is no reason the Kaino should remain politically fractured, when instead they could take their place alongside their brothers and sisters beneath our benevolent outstretched arms."

 S98_supplanting_tamajoba_title:0 "Supplanting the Tamajoba"
 S98_supplanting_tamajoba_desc:0 "During the Second Fangaulan Empire, the Tamajoba were sent to the jungles of Dao Nako to rule over the Kaino banished to its wooded depths. Over the years this has led to the Tamajoba oppressing our newfound allies. We now have the chance to redress this injustice and make their relationship more equal by turning both cultures into subjects of the great Bibyobi realm."

 S98_settling_among_jiromji_title:0 "Among the Jiromji"
 S98_settling_among_jiromji_desc:0 "The Jiromji settled the shores of Dao Nako after our ancestors fled. A mercantile folk, the Halflings of Fahvanosy have long traded and built connections with them. It is time we welcome these canny folk as sons and daughters of Bibyobi."

 S98_fangaulan_syncretism_title:0 "Inlaws for the Great Family"
 S98_fangaulan_syncretism_desc:0 "The Fangaulan Pantheon worships a mix of totem animals, deified ancestors and gods, the chief of which is Aro. A half-Genie who freed the people of Fangaula from enslavement by their genie masters and banished a powerful lich named Kaino, Aro is the chief of the pantheon. Truthfully, these beliefs are not so different from our own. It makes sense then, that we incorporate Aro and the other members of the Fangaulan pantheon into our Great Family. In this way, we can bring our people closer together."

 S98_our_dao_nako_title:0 "Our Dao Nako"
 S98_our_dao_nako_desc:0 "We can finally claim all of the Dao Nako, our ancestral home, as our own again. While humans still make up the majority of people living in the jungle, we are its true rulers. This is even more evident in the now prosperous cities, towns and villages that dot what was once only home to monsters and beasts. We truly have made the Dao Nako ours again."

 S98_rest_of_fangaulans_title:0 "The Northern Fangaulans"
 S98_rest_of_fangaulans_desc:0 "The people of the Dao Nako are firmly and peacefully under our rule. But the jungle-dwellers only represent half of the Fangaulan people. To the north lie the vast plains that the remaining Fangaulan cultures call their home. In order to bring peace and stability to these lands, we will need to venture forth from the jungle and master the Fangaulan plains."

 S98_horashesh_title:0 "Horashesh Reclaimed"
 S98_horashesh_desc:0 "To our east lies Horashesh. Once an integral part of the great empire of our ancestors, this land is now inhabited primarily by humans. For hundreds of years these humans answered to the Kheteratans of the Mother's Sorrow and their feline demigods, but the latest invasion of the Gnolls has put an end to that. Now the path is open for the Horasheshi to be led by us."

 S98_fighting_the_khet_title:0 "Fighting the Khet"
 S98_fighting_the_khet_desc:0 "The Khetists have been used to ruling the lands of Horashesh for centuries. The local Noukahi, the Khetist word for those south of the Mother's Sorrow, have struggled to hold onto power in their own lands because of the overstepping of these foreign cat-worshippers. And now the Khetists raid and pillage our lands. They see our presence as a threat to their rule in these lands… as they should. For we will rend their ill-gotten lands from their dead hands."

 S98_chibuswa_reclaimed_title:0 "Vadronoma Reclaimed"
 S98_chibuswa_reclaimed_desc:0 "The famed City of Beauty, Chibuswa, and its haughty Medawor lords have reluctantly learned to bow to us, their new masters. And while the city built upon the riches amassed by the Horakheti truly lives up to its moniker, an even greater marvel can be found close by. Vadronoma, the Lizardgate of old and one of the Anamona, the marvelous bee-hive cities of our ancestors, overlooks the tranquil waters of the Seahorse Passage. It is only fitting that we have restored it to its long lost glory and turned it into the stronghold from which we shall control all of Horashesh."

 S98_fighting_imperialism_title:0 "Vestiges of Empire"
 S98_fighting_imperialism_desc:0 "Since the Second Fangaulan Empire, the Binwarji people have occupied the highest rungs of government. Even with the collapse of the empire, the Binwarji still find themselves ruling over others. The Kaino, Jiromji and Tamajoba in Dao Nako have long been under their yoke. With large swaths of Dao Nako now under our control, it is time we take on the Binwarji themselves. Without their heavy-handed oppression, the rest of Fangaula will be free to join our cause."

 S98_the_amezatany_title:0 "The Amezatany"
 S98_the_amezatany_desc:0 "Our people, the Amezatany, have been disjointed for centuries, but all share the same dream, recreating our historic empire. We have already relied upon the resources of our former overlords, Rayafo, but the rest of the Amezatany have yet to lend their help. We need to be a unified people if we intend to rule both Fangaula and Horashesh."

 S98_fahvanosy_title:0 "Fahvanosy United"
 S98_fahvanosy_desc:0 "The many islands of Fahvanosy were the salvation of our ancestors once upon a time, when the Anamona of the mainland were lost to us and our kin on these islands opened their arms and homes to those fleeing to their shores. While it is our most noble duty to restore Vyzemby rule over our ancestral homeland, we would be remiss if we ignored the plight of our island kin embroiled in petty tribal feuds. Only by uniting all the many clans, republics and petty kingdoms on these islands under our rule can we bring lasting peace to Fahvanosy and direct the boundless energy of our brothers and sisters towards a higher purpose."

 S98_liberating_the_north_title:0 "Liberating the North"
 S98_liberating_the_north_desc:0 "Besides the province of Chibuswa, the north of Horashesh has traditionally had the strongest Khetist presence. Closest to the Mother of Sorrow, the plains of northern Horashesh are home to Khetist nations and their sympathisers amongst the local tribes. If these traitors to their own freedom are not brought to heel, there will be no way to bring the Efegerzmu of the South and coast under our sway."

 S98_ultimatum_to_efegerzmu_title:0 "Ultimatum to the Efergezmu"
 S98_ultimatum_to_efegerzmu_desc:0 "The Efergezmu of eastern Horashesh are now free from their Khetist oppressors, but unfortunately for them they have not shown us the proper deference that we deserve. Instead, they go about their business as if it was not us who freed them. It is time they either bend the knee, or die standing."

 S98_last_of_khetists_title:0 "The Last of the Medasi"
 S98_last_of_khetists_desc:0 "Horashesh has been cleansed of the Khetist infestation that sapped the will for freedom from its people. However, to the north a final stronghold of Khetists still threatens our rule. The regions of Khetapera remain staunchly under the sway of these cat-worshippers and unless we stamp them out, they will always remain an existential threat to our peaceful rule of Horashesh. It is time we set forth for a final campaign to ensure our hold over our loyal Noukahi subjects."

 S98_noukahi_syncretism_title:0 "Divine Halfling Heroes"
 S98_noukahi_syncretism_desc:0 "The Noukahi Pantheon is actually formed by a disparate group of interrelated faiths and belief systems. Each culture has their own primary deity, but the rituals, rites and systems of worship all resemble each other. Chief among their religious figures are the past heroes they worship, and we are nothing if not heroes. Let us put forth our greatest rulers as heroes worth worshipping in the eyes of our Noukahi subjects."

 S98_halfling_kolovadoy_title:0 "The Halfling Kolovadoy"
 S98_halfling_kolovadoy_desc:0 "The Kolovadoy, the hero prophesied by Jyva to unite the coast and restore the Ananoma, has long been a source of hope for both the Noukahi faithful and the Halflings of Sarhal. The Zuvavim have even harbored hopes that the long-awaited hero may actually be a human. We will put an end to any such pretense. The Kolovadoy is a halfling, and our ruler is as good a match as any to claim such a title."

 flavour_bibyobi.001.t:0 "Our New Land"
 flavour_bibyobi.001.d:0 "For generations the Amezatany have told tales of their great empire on the Sarhaly mainland. From the far depths of the Dao Nako jungle to the lustrous shores of Horashesh, the Halflings led a charmed and peaceful life. But hard times and evil men brought changes, and these changes pushed the Halflings into the ocean. Our ancestors fled the waves of humans that descended on their jeweled Ananoma and settled in Fahvanosy. Since then, we have led a comfortable life on our islands full of spice, but it is time we reclaim what was once ours. All the shores of the Seahorse Sea belong to the Amezatany and the adventurers of Bibyobi will be the proud vanguard of our return.\n\n We are in this land as a Sponsored Adventurer Band. Our overlords in Rayafo want us to conquer and spread our culture and faith for them. They expect a return on investment, and in 35 years or when we have conquered a sufficient amount of land, they will want to redefine this relationship. If we are able to successfully reform our government before then, we will better poised to fend off any advances from our gracious overlord."
 flavour_bibyobi.001.a:0 "We set forth..."
 flavour_bibyobi.002.t:0 "Monster Parts"
 flavour_bibyobi.002.d:0 "We can use one of the monster parts we have collected to give us a short boon."
 flavour_bibyobi.002.a:0 "Hydra Blood"
 flavour_bibyobi.002.b:0 "Ninki Nanka Eyes"
 flavour_bibyobi.002.c:0 "Asanbosam Claws"
 flavour_bibyobi.002.e:0 "Ancient Relic"
 flavour_bibyobi.002.f:0 "Go Back"
 flavour_bibyobi.002.tt1:0 "The simple thought of tapping in the power of another relic is enough to make [Root.Monarch.GetName] severely ill."
 flavour_bibyobi.002.tt2:0 "We have [Root.bibyobi_ancient_relics.GetValue] ancient relics left. This will use one of them."
 flavour_bibyobi.100.t:0 "Taking Control"
 flavour_bibyobi.100.d:0 "Decades ago we set forth from Rayafo to spread civilization among the natives of Fangula and beyond. Now we can look back at years of bloodshed to see that we have truly reached our goal. Large swaths of land once in the hands of foreign savages is not cultivated by true [Root.Culture.GetGroupName] people. However, those in Rayafo still see our conquests as theirs. After years of cowtowing to their sponsorship, it is time we take what we have done for ourselves. We are our own people, with our own rulers!"
 flavour_bibyobi.100.a:0 "Independence!"
 flavour_bibyobi.100.b:0 "On second thought..."
 flavour_bibyobi.200.t:0 "Monster Hunting"
 flavour_bibyobi.200.d:0 "Purifying the Land… For Profit!" \n\nEvery tavern-goer in Zokek was familiar with the cry by now. Bibyobi has had its fair share of beast tamers and monster slayers since its founding. Bibyobi translated to Beast Camp after all. But this whirlwind of recruiting had never been seen before. Thousands had signed up to join the official Monster Hunters of Bibyobi, and they were seeking thousands more. Ostensibly to purify the land of all sorts of foul and malodorous beast and sell whatever can be harvested from the corpse. With the fervor these monster hunters organized, it was sure to be an adventure.\n\n In order to reclaim the jungle of Dao Nako it must first be purified of the evil monsters that lurk in its depths. It is the official order of the crown of Bibyobi that the Monster Hunters be organized to hunt and kill these terrors!"
 flavour_bibyobi.200.a:0 "Purifying the Land… For Profit!"
 flavour_bibyobi.201.t:0 "Khetist Incursions"
 flavour_bibyobi.201.d:0 "Raids in the plains of Fangaula and Horashesh have been commonplace for centuries, but such indifference to proper ownership cannot be taken lightly if we are to rule these lands. Lately, Khetist raiders from the northeast of our lands have become more and more brazen in their attacks on our ranchers and villages. With little regard for anything beyond the loot they can carry on the backs of their horses, these raiders sow destruction while we try to sow seeds for harvest. It is time we retaliate with force."
 flavour_bibyobi.201.a:0 "We must bring peace to these plains."
 flavour_bibyobi.202.t:0 "What to do about the Kaino"
 flavour_bibyobi.202.d:0 "The Kaino have long been the persecuted of the Fangaulan people. Ever since their ancestors supported a malevolent Lich, these people were banished to the depths of the Dao Nako jungle and branded with the name of the Lich they supported. The Tamajoba people were even sent to Dao Nako to look over the Kaino and act as their rulers. But now it is time for that yoke to be dismantled. The Kaino should lead themselves, but they still require the gentle guidance of our hand."
 flavour_bibyobi.202.a:0 "Let us shepherd the Kaino to greatness."
 flavour_bibyobi.203.t:0 "The Matter of the Medasi"
 flavour_bibyobi.203.d:0 "Ever since the defeat of Kheterata at the hands of the gnolls, Horashesh has been in political turmoil. Once advised by Khetist bureaucrats called Medawor, the local rulers, called the Efergezmu, have now entered a powersharing agreement in which they find themselves dissatisfied. Local elections between the Medawor and Efergezmu end in deadlock or dissatisfied parties as often as not. The landed Medawor, on their vast estates, exert unproportionate power on the traditional Efergezmu political structure and wrest power for themselves. This powersharing has left the Horasheshi divided and the locals hungry for a rebalancing of the scales of state, and our thumb on their side might just tip the situation in their favor."
 flavour_bibyobi.203.a:0 "We must support the Efergezmu!"
 flavour_bibyobi.204.t:0 "Griot Tales"
 flavour_bibyobi.204.d:0 "The Griots are the traditional storytellers of Horashesh. Purveyors of ancient knowledge telling of heroes, ideals and great events, the Griots form the basis of the Noukahi Pantheon's oral tradition. With our battles in the north against Khetist raiders, some Griots have begun telling tales of our deeds further in the south, where pro-Khetist sentiments run colder. It might behoove us to aid the Griots in spreading these tales, as they are integral to the Horasheshi understanding of current events in the wider world. We might even win allies if the stories are good enough."
 flavour_bibyobi.204.a:0 "Support these Noukahi strorytellers!"
 flavour_bibyobi.204.b:0 "Let them tell stories of their own accord."
 flavour_bibyobi.205.t:0 "Chibuswa Riots"
 flavour_bibyobi.205.d:0 "It seems the tales of our victories over the Khetists spread by the Griots of the Noukahi have had a far greater impact than we could have imagined. In Chibuswa, the furthest southern Khetist stronghold nestled on the shore, massive riots have broken out. Some claim a Noukahi extremist, spurred by the stories of Khetist defeats in the north, attacked a Khetist school. Others claim that actually the Khetists themselves began the riots in order to spur their northern allies to invade. Regardless of the spark, Noukahi and Khetist are now pitted against each other in a running battle on the streets and in the villages. Militias are springing up on both sides to protect their people. The local governors seem unable, or unwilling, to quell the violence. With a large trading presence, we have a foothold that we could exploit. In order to bring peace to Chibuswa, we could send in a peacekeeping force."
 flavour_bibyobi.205.a:0 "This is our opportunity to seize control of the situation!"
 flavour_bibyobi.205.b:0 "Let the current owners handle this. It is not worth the backlash."
 flavour_bibyobi.205.c:0 "Wait, we already own Chibuswa. Damn rebels."
 flavour_bibyobi.206.t:0 "Fangaulan Syncretism"
 flavour_bibyobi.206.d:0 "The Fangaulan religious practices are not so different than our own. Their gods most certainly exist, as do ours, so there is no need for strict divisions between our people. The Nakavy Avo is the Great Family, after all. It is time that we bring these two faiths together, and with them our peoples. The Fangaulan people are traditionally split into two camps, those that inhabit the great jungles of Dao Nako and those that roam the vast plains to the north. While they all recognize their gods as powerful, the different factions often prefer some gods over others. Should we prioritize the gods of the plains or the gods of the jungle?"
 flavour_bibyobi.206.a:0 "Of the Jungle."
 flavour_bibyobi.206.b:0 "Of the Plains."
 flavour_bibyobi.207.t:0 "The Efergezmu Ultimatum"
 flavour_bibyobi.207.d:0 "Our conquest of northern Horashesh is complete. With the Medawor Khetists soundly defeated in their strongholds, it is time the Efergezmu of the south and east are properly integrated in our realms administration. While we have supported their rise to power, our intent was never to allow them complete autonomy. Without our guiding hand, they will surely soon again fall prey to the internal divisions and machinations of outside forces that brought devastation to these lands for decades. But we are not without magnanimity, we will give them a choice - join us, or fall before our armies. We cannot let Horashesh remain divided anymore."
 flavour_bibyobi.207.a:0 "Horashesh will be ours, one way or the other!"
 flavour_bibyobi.207.b:0 "There is nobody left to oppose us outside the Zuvavim."
 flavour_bibyobi.208.t:0 "The Tale of the Kolovadoy"
 flavour_bibyobi.208.d:0 "The Kolovadoy is the sacred hero who will reclaim the Ananoma and the ancestral lands of the Halflings of southern Sarhal as foretold by Jyva. The Zuvavim nobility believe this hero to be a human, but this has been proven demonstrably false by our deeds. It is clear the Kolovadoy is a halfling, and that this prophecy is to be fulfilled by the rulers of Bibyobi. It is time we force everyone to acknowledge the truth of this prophecy and lay claim to the title we have earned. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is the Kolovadoy, may [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] be the first of a sacred line of chosen rulers."
 flavour_bibyobi.208.a:0 "To the Kolovadoy!"
 flavour_bibyobi.209.t:0 "The Ultimatum"
 flavour_bibyobi.209.d:0 "Bibyobi believes that they have the right to call themselves our protectors and overlords. It is true that they have fought against the Khetists to aid us, but that does not mean we must subjugate ourselves to them."
 flavour_bibyobi.209.a:0 "We will accept their rule."
 flavour_bibyobi.209.b:0 "We will not be ruled by Bibyobi!"
 flavour_bibyobi.300.t:0 "Monster Hunting Resources"
 flavour_bibyobi.300.d:0 "We are about to go on a monster hunt! Should we assign extra resources to the endevour?"
 flavour_bibyobi.300.a:0 "More Money!"
 flavour_bibyobi.300.b:0 "More Men!"
 flavour_bibyobi.300.c:0 "Bring an experienced general!"
 flavour_bibyobi.300.e:0 "We are done here."
 flavour_bibyobi.301.t:0 "Where to Search"
 flavour_bibyobi.301.d:0 ""Thousands of us must've fallen for that load based on the number of poor slobs I am surrounded by. One week long bender and I get myself into this. A pound of mealy bread and the chewiest rashers of bacon I have seen. Day in and day out. Almost more monotonous than the marching. You think with all them heads a hydra would be easy to find, but no. As the man carrying all of the Esteemed Leader's baggage, this incessant walk through the jungle is less than peaceful. Maybe I will suggest we reach out to the locals to see if they have an idea of where to go." - Ralambo Tallfriend, Courier to the Esteemed Leader of the Bibyobi Monster Hunters"
 flavour_bibyobi.301.a:0 "Ask the locals if they have seen the hydra."
 flavour_bibyobi.301.b:0 "Have the mages scry for the monster."
 flavour_bibyobi.301.c:0 "We will find it ourselves."
 flavour_bibyobi.302.t:0 "The Battle of Many Heads"
 flavour_bibyobi.302.d:0 ""Looks like tomorrow is the day. Just over the ridge is that nasty bugger, bigger than I imagined it could ever be. Five heads jutting out of its massive frame. Looks like someone lashed massive snakes to the body of an elephant. Now since the day is finally here, most of the good cheer… the little we had anyway… is all gone. Grim faces circle the campfires where the men fry up what might be the last piece of sinewy bacon they will ever eat. That dour mood lasts all the way up to the officers' tents. Here, the experienced monster hunters seem almost relaxed. Chatting about loves back home or somehow procuring tastier rations. I have overheard plans for the battle. Seems like our options are limited." - Ralambo Tallfriend, Courier to the Esteemed Leader of the Bibyobi Monster Hunters"
 flavour_bibyobi.302.a:0 "Focus on the body."
 flavour_bibyobi.302.b:0 "Focus on the heads."
 flavour_bibyobi.302.c:0 "We need to cut off the heads and cauterize the wounds."
 flavour_bibyobi.303.t:0 "The Heads of the Hydra"
 flavour_bibyobi.303.d:0 ""One hell of a fight. Hundreds dead on our side compared to one dead hydra. Must've had fifteen heads total by the time it was laid down for good, so a few score men per head, give or take. I am sure the people back home will reckon that a fair trade. Fairer yet is the harvest of this beast. I overheard the mage they keep around describing all these parts to the Esteemed Leader hisself, starting with those big heads." - Ralambo Tallfriend, Courier to the Esteemed Leader of the Bibyobi Monster Hunters"
 flavour_bibyobi.303.a:0 "We will use the heads as a warning to any who may attack us!"
 flavour_bibyobi.304.t:0 "The Blood of the Hydra"
 flavour_bibyobi.304.d:0 ""Even more interesting than those big heads is the beast's blood. Even now some of the men are gettin' ill just being near the stuff. More poisonous than any snake's venom, I heard. Glad I am not one of the poor fools who got wrangled into draining the stuff before it dried. I'd much rather have the beast eat my head clean off then waste away after touching a drop of that foul sanguine gore." - Ralambo Tallfriend, Courier to the Esteemed Leader of the Bibyobi Monster Hunters"
 flavour_bibyobi.304.a:0 "We will dip our arrows in the poisoned blood."

This time it's one of them Ninka Nankas we are hunting. Even the Esteemed Leader seems scared of this one. Lots of rumors about evil magics shooting from its eyes and the ability to control water. I think I am an open-minded fellow, but a beast that can control water is too much even for my humble mind. Regardless it seems the Esteemed Leader thinks we need to harry the beast from up the river to the shore where our navy can partake in its demise. I must confess, I am unclear on the details of how he plans on moving an invisible water-dwelling beast, though.” - Ralambo Tallfriend, First Messenger to the Esteemed Leader of the Bibyobi Monster Hunters"

I reckon there is enough blood to give every little jungle creature 'round here a bath thrice over. Turns out the Ninki Nanka can control the tides on account of the number of men and pack mules that have turned up drowned. And if you don't have the luck of drowning it will eat your head clean off. Seems to be a common pattern with these monsters, always ripping the heads clean off. We did get it to the shore, though. And at first light our revenge shall be all-encompassing. Boats at the mouth of the river and us… ready to drive the beast forth one final time." - Ralambo Tallfriend, First Messenger to the Esteemed Leader of the Bibyobi Monster Hunters"

There is always time for harvesting our well-earned spoils, though. For this evil creature, it seems the eyes are what we want to be cutting out. It's said, by those who know such things, that the eyes of this monstrosity can strike a man down with just a look. I will say, the men who first engaged the beast are not faring too well, with many keeled over and emptying their guts. If this is because of some magical eyeball, or just coming down from the nerves of battle, time will tell.” - Ralambo Tallfriend, Courier to the Esteemed Leader of the Bibyobi Monster Hunters"

Bowels all twisted in knots and screaming for their gods, lovers and mothers, often in that order. Anyhow, the dead are dead, but it seems that there is just a little more life in this world than we had thought. The hatchlings of that Ninki Nanka beast have been discovered. In all his Glorious Wisdom, it seems that our Esteemed Leader means to raise these pups as his own attack dogs.

The folk of Garanke have welcomed us with open arms, and we have heavily patronized their taverns and market stalls in kind.

Tonight they will attempt a spell to force these Wereleopards to change form, but the change will be maladjusted.

Of even more interest, to a great understander of history like myself, are the ancient ruins we found when clearing the jungle of the dead. Not much more than a hole in the side of a hill from the outside, this truly is a ruin of our halfling ancestors.

These people have been hiding in these jungles since our ancestors left these lands for Fahvanosy, and we are just meeting with 'em now outside a great ruin. Well, meeting might not be the best choice of word, for they are standing at the mouth of the ancient structure with their spears leveled at us and muttering in their tongue.
