 #Gov reforms and mechanics
 clerical_vic_estate:0 "Clerical Vic Estate"
 clerical_vic_estate_desc:0 "This state of the Blue Reach is ruled by its clergy, who derive their right to rule directly from the doctrinal tenets of the realm’s dominant faith. The merchants of this state are kept far from the formal levers of power, but their concerns and interests manage to seep through via a network of informal connections that prominent merchants and their business interests have established with the church. Consequently, this state has a keen interest in the balance of power of the region’s Vic Leagues, both as a way of enriching the state’s coffers and as a means of evangelization within and beyond the trade network."
 aristocratic_vic_estate:0 "Aristocratic Vic Estate"
 aristocratic_vic_estate_desc:0 "This state of the Blue Reach is ruled by its leading families, all of noble blood, or close enough to it that nobody dares make a fuss. Although the merchants of this state are closely intertwined with the crown, the royal family and its allies consciously promote an image of nobility and strength to the outside world which transcends petty money-grubbing concerns. As the best method of projecting strength in the Blue Reach is domination of one of the region’s Vic Leagues, this state dedicates a great deal of diplomatic effort towards this goal, all with the aim of enhancing their prestige among the other states of the Blue Reach."
 republican_vic_estate:0 "Republican Vic Estate"
 republican_vic_estate_desc:0 "This state of the Blue Reach is ruled by its merchants, who exchange power between one another every so often in a system of elections. Consequently, this state is very concerned with trade and the balance of trade in the Blue Reach, orienting most of its foreign policy around the Vic Leagues and its membership and position within one of or neither of them."
 ragnian_commonwealth:0 "Ragnian Commonwealth"
 ragnian_commonwealth_desc:0 "This realm traces its heritage back to the Ragni Federation, an alliance of Alenic tribes who first settled the Blue Reach a millennium ago. The Ragni nobly defended the Blue Reach against its enemies for many years, and even when they finally succumbed to the might of the Gawedi, the Ragni refused to let the flame of Reach independence die out.\n\nHaving unified the Blue Reach, this realm takes a great deal of inspiration from the Ragni. Its government prioritizes internal Vic autonomy over the benefits of further centralization, and has resolved to carry the principles of the Ragni forward as it expands to Gerudia and beyond."
 vic_formalization_of_league_rights:0 "Formalization of League Rights"
 vic_formalization_of_league_rights_desc:0 "The council of the Reach has by tradition always granted any city with a seat on it certain informal rights intended to protect them and promote their interests. Council members conduct free trade between one another, freely organize their levies within the army of the Reach, and are free to openly criticize decisions made by the Reach government within the council. Furthermore, they have total control over the laws controlling the governing structure of their individual territories.\n\nThese traditions are firmly established within Reach culture yet only recently formalized. By codifying them within Reach law it will decrease the administrative burden of the central government of the Reach and make it clear to all that membership in the Vic League means that these ancient rights of theirs shall stand for all time."

 flavour_vic_league.0.t:0 "The Rise of Vic Leagues"
 flavour_vic_league.0.d:0 "The Blue Reach stands independent, but it is beset from all sides. The Gawedi in the south have coveted the Blue Reach for centuries, and stand ready to subjugate its cities under the rule of the House of Gerwick. To the east, gray orcs have already invaded the noble realm of Vrorenmarch, and the White Reachmen migrating to our lands bear dire warnings that we might very well be next. To the north the Gerudians across the Giant’s Grave Sea always have and always will see the Blue Reach as a strongbox to be raided, funding future raids.\n\nBetween the Gawedi and other threatening monsters, the Reach has recognized the need to stand together. The resulting Vic Leagues commit the cities of the Blue Reach to trade together and stand together, but Reach politics are ever-shifting. If the League leaders of Bayvic and Celmaldor do not lead wisely, they may soon find themselves in charge of no league at all, or even become the newest province of Gawed themselves.\n\nWithin this chaos, the city of [Root.GetName] stands ready to make a name for itself."
