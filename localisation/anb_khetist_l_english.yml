 khetist.1.t:0 "Holy Play of the Compassionate Mother"
 khetist.1.d:0 "A Gnollish Playwright named Inykh Wisetongue has written a remarkable play about morality filled with laughter, trickery and divine mercy.\n\nIn his story, a clever commoner named Ghafer together with his fearful friend Cheoz wander through the winding alleys and sun-baked courtyards of Toesah. Surviving through their wit alone, they deceive greedy priests, corrupt merchants and even pompous Khets, not out of malice but out of desperation to escape hunger, poverty and injustice.\n\nThis everyday life is disrupted when the dreaded raider Xheneva Peasantcrusher storms Toesah, Chaos and death follows. Ghafer and Xheneva and others except Cheoz all meet their end…  yet the tale continues.\n\nOn the other side of life, the other side of the Sorrow, sits Elikhet on a shining throne. All the dead characters from the story appear before him: Ghafer, Xheneva, the greedy priest, corrupt merchant and even a Khet. As Elikhet is judging said souls and weighing their sins, Nirakhet appears, pleading for mercy, Her words speak not of punishment, but that of compassion, that any being may find redemption if their heart is true.\n\nIn the end, due to Nirakhet’s plea, the characters are forgiven and go to the afterlife, and Ghafer through his wit is granted a second chance in life. He wakes just as Cheoz is wrapping him in bandages for his funeral. In the end, Ghafer and Cheoz leave the town of Toesah to spread their message of forgiveness.\n\nThe play has spread across taverns and temples of Southern Kheterata, spreading laughter and sometimes even prayer. Yet some priests call it sacrilege, a jest that dares to place the mercy of the divine in the mouth of fools.\n\nHow shall we respond to this work of faith?"
 khetist.1.a:0 "Even a trickster’s laughter may carry the voice of Nirakhet."
 khetist.1.b:0 "This mockery dishonors Elikhet, Silence it at once!"
 khetist.1.c:0 "Sponsor Inykh’s work, Faith and Laughter, hand in hand."

 khetist.2.t:0 "Cow Based Folktale"
 khetist.2.d:0 "A new fancy has spread among the common folk, a play dubbed “The Cow of Cloth”. No traditional Khetist tale, the story, originally gnollish, is told through dance, song and pageantry. Usually presented by a group of gnolls who seek to entertain the public, it combines both piety and comedy.\n\nA humble gnollish herder owns a strong and gentle cow. One year, the cow falls ill, threatening the livelihood of the herder. Desperate, the herder turns to Nirakhet, praying to her for mercy.\n\nBut it isn’t the simple story that attracts folks; it is the manner in which it is reenacted. When the gnoll dressed as the cow collapses, dancers and musicians mimic the herder’s grief, while mischievous gnolls play side roles, sometimes moving among the audience, making sly comments or thieving morsels from the watchers’ hands. Greedy merchants try to take advantage of the scenario, foolish priests scorn the farmer for his faith in Nirakhet, but just as all seems lost, Nirakhet blesses and restores the cow to health. Thus the common folk are reminded that mercy and devotion are stronger than greed and cruelty.\n\nLaughter and tears accompany applauds as the tale unfolds. Some priests bless performances such as these, seeing them as a celebration of divine compassion. Others comment that such humor must be sacrilege, for who dares to make a cow the centerpiece of a story on the divine?\n\nThe Clergy comes to us on the matter."
 khetist.2.a:0 "Let the festival go on! Music, dance, and faith bring us together."
 khetist.2.b:0 "Ensure the story of the cow does not stray into heresy or superstition"
 khetist.2.c:0 "Sponsor these Gnolls"
 
 khetist.3.t:0 "Shocking Secret"
 khetist.3.d:0 "We firmly believe that our religious law, the Mariat, is sacred and beyond doubt, but recent documents excavated by a scholar in Wesdam have the potential to shake this conviction.\n\nThese documents tell the tale of a mage from the Damerian Republic, Crescies Silverinus Valentis, who attempted to disguise himself as a Khet to infiltrate the Sorrow and steal the secrets of our magic. The scholarly consensus after comparing this find with established historical and religious texts tends towards a cautious acknowledgement that he may very well be the renowned \"Damerian Khet\" out of legends and tales from the period of Damerian influence over Kheterata. This legendary figure is characterised by a lack of any records regarding his early years, a preference for Damerian culture, and an astonishing diligence. What is concerning is that the Khetarch during his time appears to have issued many rulings under his guidance.\n\nWe failed to contain the news in time, and it has already begun to spread among the populace. Although truly devout individuals will not waver in their faith because of this, it may cause confusion among the ignorant commoners. Some suggest that our steward continue to support the validity of these rulings as before, as even doubting a single decision of a previous Khetarch could fatally damage the legitimacy of the entire legislative corpus. Others advise the steward to seize this opportunity to conduct a comprehensive review of the Mariat, using the pretext of preserving its purity to suppress rulings favourable to various local sects."
 khetist.3.a:0 "In any case, these are the indisputable rulings of a Khetarch."
 khetist.3.b:0 "We must review our Mariat thoroughly."
 khetist.3.c:0 "Move these documents to my study, quickly!"
 
 khetist.4.t:0 "Dangerous Thoughts"
 khetist.4.d:0 "\"As Elikhet proclaimed, 'Justice is omnipresent, self-evident, not susceptible to compulsion.' The sole path to becoming a Khetist lies in consciously embracing the way of life and making that choice freely. It ought not to be a coerced pretense to curry favor with officials, driven by fear of state-ordered reprisals. Rulers have at times attempted to impose the faith upon their subjects, seeking to legitimize their dominion in the name of Elikhet, yet such acts in no way reflect a genuine intent to uphold the tenets of the Mariat.\"\n'Musings on Genuine Devotion', a popular pamphlet by an anonymous author\n\nThoughts of this ilk are like the weeds that cling to the banks of the Sorrow: they surge forth time and again, and left untended, they will fester into grievous trouble. They assert the existence of a secular state, one that shall never claim the authority to enforce the Mariat, our religious law. [Root.Monarch.GetName], having contended with such issues countless times throughout [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] long reign, is now determined to resolve this dispute once and for all - at least for the remainder of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] lifetime."
 
 khetist.4.a:0 "Their arguments are not without merit."
 khetist.4.b:0 "It is the state's inherent duty to uphold the rules of the faith."
 khetist.4.c:0 "We are merely guiding everyone along the truly benevolent path.

 khetist.5.t:0 "A Stickler for the Rules?"
 khetist.5.d:0 "Khetists are often bewildered by the many varying aspects of their faith. Officially, they worship Elikhet and his kin above all others and, for the more formal parts, the rulings of the Elikhet. But these rulings are few and far-between, given the lazy natures of even the oldest and most respectable - if their behaviour could be called that - Khets. So when it comes to the different sects and their customs, most people leave each other to their own ways. Recently however, a priest has objected to [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName]'s practice of some esoteric ritual, of which they say is technically incorrect and should be punished. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] argues that it is not the priest's place to speak on this and that it is an overreach from them."
 khetist.5.a:0 "Does it really matter?"
 khetist.5.b:0 "Oh really? Well, if you say so."

 khetist.6.t:0 "Late to the Liturgical Party"
 khetist.6.d:0 "Last night's sacrifice to Elikhet went well, except for the small detail of the scholar responsible for the sacrifice proceedings turning up late, half-drunk on the finest Oronsinoman banana beer. The following events meant that instead of the pig guts required for that specific ceremony - according to the Elikhet Decree of 867 AA - measly chicken feet were set on the pyre. This has left a group of very angry clergy and disappointed revelers."
 khetist.6.a:0 "Oh dear."
 khetist.6.b:0 "Blame it on him then!"

 khetist.7.t:0 "A Completely Valid Interpretation"
 khetist.7.d:0 "Our great scholars have found a semantic loophole in the words left by Elikhet! Instead of a semicolon, a comma should have been used, and now it claims we own the whole world! While the rest of Halann may not take us seriously, we nonetheless have a newfound confidence and pride that we will bring to the negotiating table when we embark on our next conquests!"
 khetist.7.a:0 "Why, this makes complete sense and doesn't sound fake at all!"
 khetist.7.b:0 "Don't be ridiculous."

 khetist.8.t:0 "We Cannot All Do Great Things"
 khetist.8.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] was working in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] study before [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looked out of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] window, bored of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] endless paperwork and the machinations of the realm. Looking around [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes wandered and noticed many things. The children running around on the streets, vendors selling their many wonderful wares, even a local priest giving alms to the poor. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s eyes lingered on the priest, and coming to the forefront of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind were memories from when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was a child, of when [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s tutors taught [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] of the many tenants of Khetism -  specifically, that of charity and giving to the poor. As the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the most powerful person in the land and the role model of the people, was [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] not also supposed to take part in this virtue?"
 khetist.8.a:0 "...But we can do small things with great love."
 khetist.8.b:0 "...But the world can learn from us."
 khetist.8.c:0 "Bah, Humbug!"

 khetist.9.t:0 "A Riverside Farm"
 khetist.9.d:0 "The people of the Khetist faiths have long since learned to respect rivers great and small - their ancestors having been taught by the capricious floods of many a great river. Knowing this, Elikhet left many teachings on how to care for them and use them for endeavors such as agriculture, watermills and other production methods. One of our priests, in tandem with a farmer, has managed to use one of these teachings - with a few tweaks - to tremendous effect, creating a spell to promote growth and prosperity on even the smallest of rivers and tributaries. The massive new stocks of grain and livestock must be put to use, but to what end?"
 khetist.9.a:0 "For the troops!"
 khetist.9.b:0 "For the people!"
