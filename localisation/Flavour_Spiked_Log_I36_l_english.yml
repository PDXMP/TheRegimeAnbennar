 spiked_log_the_prickly_alliance_desc:0 "For the last decade, we were alone in the Woods, surrounded by cruel elves who hunted us mercilessly and mighty orcs who sought to enslave us. Most other goblin clans have already long succumbed to the alluring whispers of the treacherous fey. Even the Brambleskinner clan, who once shared our distrust toward them, ultimately fell to the traitor and dread warlock Oubblig.\n\nThe death of Oubblig and the revival of the Brambleskinner clan presents an opportunity: bringing our clans closer together, for neither of us will be able to survive without unprecedented cooperation. We shall seal this Prickly Alliance on the ruins of Oubblig’s legacy!"

 spiked_log_punish_the_traitor_desc:0 "Oubblig's legacy lies defeated. Despite its heft as the most powerful goblin clan, Oubbligschild has been shattered by the wrath of our Alliance. The Brambleskinner clan has recovered most of the Bone Grove, and even claimed a foothold outside the Woods upon the uncharted shores of Ourdia. Scouts will be sent to get information on these foreign lands… but later. Now is a time for celebration, for our friends have finally reunited their clan."

 spiked_log_end_oubbligs_legacy_desc:0 "Brambleskinner and our clan are getting more and more entangled. We share all things but our respective names: our denizens are forming mixed families, our armies march as one, and we’re even planning together to develop their newly acquired lands. And yet, further cooperation will have to wait - for there is an unexpected thorn in their side.\n\nStamping out Oubblig’s legacy has proven more troublesome than we anticipated. Most former Oubbligschild clansfolk refuse to change their wayward views towards the fey, and it is just a matter of time before they betray again. It is in our best interest to help Brambleskinner in their effort to complete their reunification. Thoroughly erasing all influence of the fey is indeed imperative for us to integrate their clan into ours, for it is the next logical step in our relationship."

She’s not as known in the Woods here as outside, but there, some even consider her a goddess. Well, I know no other gods, so I can’t compare, but I doubt they would enjoy as much as she to chug pint after pint of ale with their loved ones.’\n\nQlak the Wanderer fell silent, a bittersweet smile on his face, as if mourning a long-gone friend. As the last echoes of his voice faded, he resumed his story:\n\n‘She’s the one who set us free, you know? The Verdant Veil’s fall was her doing. She had to battle a very powerful archfey for that, and I even heard that during the fight, her sword broke down, and she had to finish barehanded! But her most commendable trait was that she could see behind appearances. Such a unique woman. She gathered a group of companions, accepting elves, big humans, small humans, and even orcs, and more surprisingly goblins! Our cousins of the Groundhawk clan followed her outside the Woods! And you know Oubblig, of course - he’s supposedly the one who helped her fight the archfey!’\n\n‘Come on, Qlak, this is nonsense! Why would the Traitor help a human fight the fey? Still, she seems like an interesting human. I would have loved to meet her.’\n\n‘You’re not alone, my friend, you’re not alone.

Of course, we will stay vigilant, but none in our clan will seek a pact with the fey ever again.’\n\n[I35.Monarch.GetName] [I35.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] finished his report to the council. As usual, he deluded himself into thinking he was a proper Clanboss, even though his title was mostly honorific now. [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] nodded in response. Internal stability was always a good thing, especially since it may help him convince his vassal that he was indeed his subject and no longer an equal.\n\nLost in thought, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was broken from his reverie by a clamor outside. The source of the disturbance soon became clear, as two goblins were borne into [Root.Capital.GetName]’s court room at the head of a crowd and swiftly introduced to the council: a Scout Squad Leader who had departed to Ourdia months ago, and a brown-skinned man in strange clothes, his head wrapped in a colorful turban.\n\n‘We are back, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! I have much news for you but it can wait. We have found new folk! Cousins we had never heard of! I still can’t get it through my head!’\n\nThe stranger seemed to inspect every detail of the room, a slight curl of the lip disappearing behind a carefully-maintained neutral expression. He introduced himself with a bow and an unfamiliar accent.\n\n‘Greetings Akal - may the Light shine upon your lands. Your servant’s name is Ezklan Zarvilka. I have the honor and the privilege of being a merchant from the glorious city of Aqatbar, the unrivaled gem of Bahar. I have heard of the riches hidden in the Deepwoods and would be interested in establishing a trade post in what you call the Bone Grove, with your approval of course. Although, I think your… arfaya… told me it was in the land of the Brambleskinner clan?’\n\n‘Welcome, Master Zarvilka, may you find rest beneath our shades.

The next step was clear, but the supplies for his army were running low, and there were not enough feystompers to sustain a lengthy war against the orcs of the Silentblade clan.\n\nHe was mulling over the situation when two people entered, seeking audience. A stubborn elder, as tough as a gnarly stump, stood beside a grey-skinned, lanky youth who seemed to have second thoughts about the entire endeavour.\n\n‘Foolishness, [Root.Monarch.GetName]’, began the elder, without even introducing himself or his companion. ‘You cut the wrong trees. The wrong trees! How will we hide from the elves? Even if you needed logs, it’s not an excuse for cutting the wrong trees!’\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] endured the onslaught with a blank expression, failing to interrupt the rant until the elder ran out of breath.\n\n‘I did what I had to do to protect my clan. Who are you to criticise your [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?’\n\n‘Zakov Sharphand. I’m the best tree feller in [Root.Capital.GetName], and I’m telling you you should let competent people cut trees for you. I know you bigshots have responsibilities and all, but we can’t have you cut the wrong trees every time your army needs more logs! They’re our home, you know!’\n\n‘What he’s meaning to say is that he wants to work for you, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’, the youth timidly explained. ‘He is really good, you know, and he…’\n\n‘Shut up, Garut. Look, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], I can help you. Just… trust in our expertise. I’ll bring you more logs that you’ll ever need. Oh, and my lad needs something to do. I took him in after he freed himself from the orcs, but he has to learn and fend for himself. He’s smart, and decent with animals, but he’s far too scrawny to make an adequate treecutter.’\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] briefly pondered the offer.\n\n‘Deal. You will gather your fellow treecutters in a cartel, and we’ll pay a fair price for the lumber as long as you meet our needs. As for you… Garut, was it? Come back tomorrow, I have a plan for which your skills could come in handy.’"

That is all for us, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].’\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sent the scout back and slumped down in his throne. Another dead end. So far, the expeditions he ordered out of the Woods had been completely unsuccessful. At least, this time, there was little chance of foes coming in from that direction. He straightened himself as the Scout Overseer rushed inside the court room.\n\n‘My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], I have news of our eastern expedition. We’ve found them. Maybe.’\n\n‘What do you mean maybe?’\n\n‘We found a pile of corpses not far from the base camp at the entrance of that huge cave; we believe we’ve identified their uniforms, but it was hard going. It was… sickening. They apparently tried to put up a fight but… we found no trace of who or what killed them.’\n\n‘Curses! We should stay away from the mountains for the time being, we have had only terrible luck with them so far! And we can not afford to send a bigger expeditionary corp inside the caves, we just don’t have enough soldiers for that... any news from the south-east scouts?’\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]’s question stayed unanswered for the next two days, until the last scouts finally came back.\n\n‘Reporting to you, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! I apologize for the lateness, we were delayed on our way back by… anyway, we found a pass through the mountains, and were able to explore a vale with a huge lake in the middle. It is inhabited by flying women - harpies, they call themselves.

The reason for the elf companion’s presence was unclear. Noppes himself, as the clan’s Head Shaman, was thrilled: learning about new cults had always been his favourite pastime.\n\n‘I am not before you as a warrior, but as an apprentice of our flock’s Riaveltu. They are… sort of like your advisor, but not. They know and pass on our songs. The Hunt is how we live, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The philosopher Nehijunus said that it is ‘a door left open’. It is not something I can teach you, but you can learn it… if you seek an answer you can not reach.’\n\n‘What’s the use of your songs if you don’t teach them?’ the elf interrupted, visibly annoyed at the harpy’s explanation. ‘Ral, you should not heed this nonsense. Are you curious about our faith? Then you should learn about Surael, the true god, who spreads His Light to protect us against the Darkness. He welcomes all, for all creatures can be the Light. You, Ral, could even be the one to bring the Light to these dark woods. And you, Telšali, even you could be the Light if you accepted to see the truth!’\n\n‘Triandil, dear, you talk about the Light, but I’ve flown closer to the Sun than you’ll ever be able to. But get too close to it, and you’ll get burnt!’\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] could tell that it was not the first time his two guests had argued about this, and that they both seemed to enjoy their oratorical bouts.

Honesty, bravery and respect were supposed to become their way of life. Well, my friend, you know how humans are - they tend to hide their flaws behind lofty ideals. These noble knights didn’t hesitate a jot to fight each other in public and steal each others’ women! Hypocritical, I know, but I couldn’t say that to their face because they were very, very strong.’\n\n‘As I recall, when they first settled here, our northern cousins told us that these knights killed them blindly and very proficiently.’\n\n‘True. Even if they ultimately failed, they also put up a glorious fight against the orcs. After all, knights ride giant beasts, whose bodies were protected by a skin of metal. Most of them run like the wind, but some can even fly and bring death from the sky. The knights themselves wear colorful armor and dress their beasts with elaborate garments. I’m telling you, their charges were a sight to behold: a tremor, followed by a cloud of dust, and then a flurry of metal and bright colors.’\n\n‘Well, that explains why the youngest riders in the military were so adamant in creating a knightly order of their own!

It seems unlikely, of course, but they do have a tremendous number of clans we have never heard of. Some were forced to the northern lands by the Greentide. Others fled to the south to avoid the orcish yoke. The rest remained in the now empty caves. And it seems we may even have more distant cousins, as big and furry as bears!’\n\n‘I really doubt those exist, Qlak. But if they do, I’m sure even they would be welcome in our clan. Nevertheless, I hope all our cousins outside here can thrive, but our doors will be open if any of them ever need it.’"

 flavor_spiked_log.16.d:0 "‘People disappearing from their beds during stormy nights. Ailing elders suddenly regaining their youth, and healthy youngsters aging decades in an instant. Lost ones coming home changed, and loved ones leaving forever. We have all witnessed situations like those. Qlak, what do you make of them?’\n\n‘Ah, my favorite tale! All the bad things in the Woods, all due to the fey, they say. My friend, some of those stories are undeniably exaggerated, but the fey are truly a tricky bunch. Annoy them, and they’ll make your days a living nightmare. Leave them alone, and they still might do that, just because they can and want to. Incur their wrath…’ For a second, the Wanderer's eyes seemed to shimmer of gold and crimson. ‘Well those tales are rare, for very few can survive their fury long enough to pass on their story. Did you know that, in the first place, most fey don’t care about goblins, orcs, or even elves? They just live, oblivious to the more… mundane inhabitants of the Woods. And many fey are completely harmless.’\n\n‘Harmless? Qlax, they steal our babies! We wouldn’t devote a huge effort to fighting something harmless! The first thing we teach our children is to distrust all fey!’\n\n‘Oh, but you’re totally right, my friend. The fey can not be trusted, even those who seem harmless. Especially those. They can trick you into meeting the archfey, and that, my friend, is something only lunatic pact seekers would want. Archfeys are all so terribly bothersome and they can jumble your mind with a flick of a finger on a whim, whenever they lose interest in you! And they all have a nasty temper! Well, except the Prince of Fools. He’s a chill lad, that one, and I’ve not met anyone who could hold a better conversation.’\n\n‘You have an awful lot to say about them, Qlak.’"

 flavor_spiked_log.17.d:0 "Qlak the Wanderer fell silent, enjoying the fragile silence spreading in the almost-empty room. He peered through a closed window, his figure outlined by the dim sunlight.\n\n‘My friend, my last tale is now finished. I must start my journey anew, for I have lingered here more than I anticipated.’\n\n‘Thank you, Qlak. This week has been truly enjoyable, and I will miss your presence. Will you come back? Wait, no, I know you won’t. But before you leave, please tell me honestly. Qlak, is it real? What you told me, the people in your stories?’\n\n‘Does it matter, my friend? Tales move hearts and make people change, even if they are not true. You too, my friend. You could step outside, and witness the changes your tales brought to the world.’\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] laughed bitterly. What effect could he have had on the world? He hadn’t left his castle for an eternity. The Cartels held most of the power now, and he was painfully aware that he was but a mere figurehead. Still, driven by a compulsion he hadn’t felt in ages, he walked to the balcony.\n\nThe noisy bustle of [Root.Capital.GetName] below hit him first, quickly followed by the sheer size of the city. It spread beyond what he could see, and most of the buildings seemed brand-new, made out of fine, ornate wood. A silvery gleam caught his eyes. A parade, fully-clad knights riding fierce feystompers with flickering tusks. The Engravers had outdone themselves, as always.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] shook his head, as if to dispel the last shreds of the fog that had clouded his mind for longer than he could remember. This was his own doing. His own tale.\n\nHe turned around to his ever-empty throne room. Was he waiting for someone? Fleeing the oppressive atmosphere, he rushed out of his throne room, under the startled look of his guards. The future belonged to the younger generations, but he could still have a part in it."

 artifice_invention_kinetic_multiplier:0 "Kinetic Multiplier"
 artifice_invention_kinetic_multiplier_desc:0 "The kinetic multiplier is a complex engraving inscribed on living feystomper tusks. It takes advantage of the transmissive property of the tusk’s ivory and comprises three distinct layers. The deepest layer connects the engraving to the feystomper’s body and accumulates energy when it charges. The middle layer serves as a foundation to the whole contraption, a unidirectional amplifier that protects the feystomper and its rider from the impact. The outer layer discharges all stored energy on impact, triggering a concentrated shock that can rip humanoid combatants to shreds and even breach solid walls.\n\nThe kinetic multiplier is usually engraved on young feystompers, to reduce the risk for both the beast and the artificer. Faulty engraving can result in the rider being crushed on impact or tossed tens of meters in the air, both outcomes deadly in the vast majority of cases. The feystomper itself is, of course, sturdy enough to resist most of the shock."
