She has been called many names for many are her years and even more are her stories. The Loving Mother is one of the most popular, the image of an old lady taking care of her beloved children the Beiklings, its an image that many girls have sought to embody during their life.\nYet this city has another popular nickname, The Old Warden - a wise elder protecting the young from the world. Many are the mothers that make Tiaochi their home, many more make Tiaochi their role model, yet only one seeks to truly embody the Old Warden.\n\nFuyuan Jiao, wife of Youji Xion, is a woman like few others. Opposite to her husband she has a strong will, a commanding presence and the ambition to see the Beiklings free once more.\n\nAnd yet…"

They have made themselves with the Mask of Wealth, hidden amongst the temples of Chinhu she lied waiting, and now they have promised it to us if we are successful in our liberation of their people."

 Z60_the_demons_title:0 "The Demons"
 Z60_the_demons_desc:0 "The Tagharoghi, the ancient institution of the Oni ogres.\nOnce they were our allies, in an era long gone they gifted our ruler with the Mask that has now become our object of power and right. Though our original alliance is long gone, ended by their own hands, they still see the use in our people, wishing to use us against the rising Eternal Council that threatens their southern position. They might be convinced to lend us help if we can negotiate and exchange."

 Z60_repay_the_league_title:0 "Repay the League"
 Z60_repay_the_league_desc:0 "In times of conflict we sought help from the League of Xiongxiap to defeat our overlords, but now we have an entirely different beast to deal with. Cunning as they are, they wish for much more reparations than what we had first negotiated. Though we could reject this change in the agreement and pursue a more hostile unification, it might prove more beneficial to follow their desires for the time being.\n\nIn truth, they hold more influence than we do currently."

 Z60_of_control_title:0 "Of Control"
 Z60_of_control_desc:0 "Many years ago, much after the arrival of Harimar and the Fall of the Empire, these hills were home to a Beikling Kingdom. A putrid domain like no other, their rulers now only known as the Rats of the Hill were tyrants like few outside conquerors have ever come close to matching. They held in power thanks to holding two of the Great Masks of our people.\nOne was the Mask of Might, now held under our grasp it allowed them and us to rise to power in the first place. The other one was lost for more than a hundred years. The Mask of Control was founded by the members of the League of Xiongxiap, a trade accord made up of former elites of the late Kingdoms and born from its demise. With its power they held control of the hills and threatened the Eternal Councils rule of the hills.\n\nIf we are to truly restore our realm we must unite with the League and claim the Mask of Control for ourselves."

 Z60_ascendant_might_desc:0 "Might, the Power to Rule.\n\nAcross the streets of the many cities that are now part of our realm there is an optimism that has not been seen in many generations. Beiklings have longed for the return to the Imperial Era yet not but once have we been even close to this glory.\n\nBut now, we are closer than ever.\n\nThe Mask of Might shall ascend to rule over a newly reborn Luzhong and bring upon a new Golden Age for the Beikling people."

 Z60_his_sorrow_title:0 "His Sorrow"
 Z60_his_sorrow_desc:0 "Youji lied, Youji continued to lie. That is all he felt he could do in this situation.\nHe lied to his advisors about the state of his wife, he lied to his daughter about the health of her mother, he lied to himself when he thought things would change for the better.\n\nTsukqiao was barely held together not by him but by Fuyuan, he did not have the charisma to deal with the clans of raiders who made Tsukqiao their home, he did not have the intelligence to keep his advisors from taking more and more control - he simply didn't have what it took to be a ruler, she did.\nBut now she is gone, and all that remains is Youji's memories of her, and amongst the echoes of his mind one voice, her voice, still called to him.\n\nNo matter the cost, no matter the time, no matter if he even had what was needed he would achieve his wife's grand dream.\nWith the winds as witnesses he shall bring freedom to the Beiklings."

 Z60_the_brothers_desc:0 "To our west, hidden amongst the ravines between Emgolù and Yinsheng one group of Beiklings has turned a profit out of the demise of the Hills. The League of Xiongxiap, an accord of traders and nobles from an era long gone, have managed to carve themselves a place inside the Eternal Council as local governors.\nThough, knowing their kind, their loyalty has a prize tag…"

 Z60_her_dream_title:0 "Her Dream"
 Z60_her_dream_desc:0 "Almost fifteen hundred years ago our Great Empire fell to ash, our people were submerged into a dark era that left us scarred. Our great cities that once rivaled the ones of the Yanhe were burned to the ground. We never recovered.\n\nAlmost four hundred years ago the last free Beikling Kingdom fell to disarray. Weak illegitimate rules abused our peoples faith to their gain, and their delusions came crashing down in flames. We never recovered.\nFrom this collapse Tsukqiao was born, a child of ruin, our dynasty held to power in Tiaochi eventually bowing loyalty to the Eternal Council to survive.\n\nBut now, times are changing. Survival is no longer enough, once more we have found the motivation to fight for our freedom - and this time we shall not fall, not again."

 Z60_the_traitor_kin_title:0 "The Traitor Kin"
 Z60_the_traitor_kin_desc:0 "A name bastardized, the Beiklings of Jianlin fight in the name of their ‘Mask of Righteousness’, they have historically being the ones to stop our raiders from making with the Yanzsins riches, in turn making our communities struggle. They style themselves enlightened, see themselves as better than their own brothers for having escaped the decline of our homeland.\nWe speak their name with repulsion, and sharpened our swords in preparation.\n\nOne way or another, Jianlin shall fall."

 Z60_of_right_title:0 "Of Right"
 Z60_of_right_desc:0 "Long ago there was a war.\n\nHundreds of Beiklings under the banner of Lanqiu, the last free beikling realm.\nRumors of the Mask of Right being hidden on the land of Balris the Golden combined with his apparent disappearance had led the putrid realm of the Ouyangs to war against the Kobolds.\n\nIn the end a Beikling made itself with the mask, though it was not one of Lanqiu's loyal.\n\nHe and his fellow man fought their own kin to keep the Kobolds safe, and it was their treason that wrought ruin to the kingdom.\nIn the end they won, they marched back home to the Yanszi and thinking themselves higher than us proclaimed that one day they shall march upon the hills to ‘free’ our people.\nThis promise was in vain, for now we shall be the ones to free them from their delusions."

 Z60_the_matriarch_title:0 "The Matriarch"
 Z60_the_matriarch_desc:0 "On the outskirts of Tiaochi, on the side of a hill, one can find the Roost of the Nuraryi Harpies.\nThey arrived to our land wishing to learn the teachings of the dark arts, following the path their Queen Kiova once did.\n\nOur relation with them has been a complicated one, though at first we saw to maintain good relations with their Matriarch a series of controversies involving members of the Xion family led to a collapse in relations that was only mended thanks to Fuyuan's intervention.\n\nThough now she is gone we might be able to use the good will she built up with their current Matriarch to get them to join us in battle."

 Z60_the_aftermath_title:0 "The Aftermath"
 Z60_the_aftermath_desc:0 "With our victory over our former overlords of Jinqiu and our independence once again secure we must now make sure the forces of the Eternal Council are fully eradicated from our land.\n\nTough Jincheng was their official capital, the truth is that the home of power was in the Jade Citadel of Heiyukcheng. We shall not let them recover their strength in the shadows, no, we must burn them from the root."

 Z60_reorganize_the_estates_title:0 "Re-Organize the Estates"
 Z60_reorganize_the_estates_desc:0 "Tsukqiao didn't inherit much from Lanqiu's demise, most of our current noble class emerged later as prominent raiders or traders and what little of the clergy remained in Tiaochi.\nOver the years this has led to our realm being organized differently than many others, with the Xion dynasty and its members keeping much power. Though in theory this means our dynasty can exceed more power over our subjects in practice it means they also have to do much of the state organization themselves. This was already problematic when our holds were limited to the city and surroundings but now it has proven to be too much of our realm to handle. We must reform the government, moving the estates' place away from their current disorganization to one that can better suit our realm."

 Z60_reform_the_eunuchs_title:0 "Reform the Eunuchs"
 Z60_reform_the_eunuchs_desc:0 "As part of Tsukqiao's protection contract from Jinqiu there was a great demand for tribute, the so-called ‘Jade Tax’. Seeing our struggle to administrate our land they provided us with a group of loyal Eunuchs, this ‘Tiaochi Compact’ has since then helped us collect our taxes and rule our land. With our emergence as the new rulers of the Yan hills it would be wise to expand the role of the Eunuchs. Moreover they have suggested the idea of helping teach our rulers, making sure the upcoming leaders of the hills have what it takes to be worthy kings."

We must prove to them what true Might looks like."

 Z60_end_the_elephants_desc:0 "Haless is the land of one thousand warriors, each with their own ways. There are those who train in the art of the sword, those who master the spear, those who become one with their horses.

With every Tyrant a new fire was born inside of us as a people, the desire for peace made way for the desire of vengence.\n\nEver since we have not rested, even at our darkest hour we kept fighting to survive.\nAnd now, we thrive.\nWith our ascension to power once more, the techniques that kept us alive until now can be reforged to dominate our enemies, our brutal ways exported to their lands as part of our armies many tactiques of warfare.\nBorn of hatred, incarnate of might.
