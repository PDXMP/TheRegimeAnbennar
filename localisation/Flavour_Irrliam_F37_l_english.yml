Our loyal Kašipti exorcist-priests have received alarming news from their counterparts in Varamhar about the secretive experiments conducted there.\nWe may not have a clear dynastic claim on the throne of lost Dalarand like some of the other great houses, but as the stalwart blade and shield of the Sun Cult, it is our sacred duty to put an end to the heresy brewing in Varamhar and bring the land and its people under our righteous protection."

Elizna’s actions during the war shattered their diplomatic reputation and made them an outcast amongst the Cinder Realms while failing to gain them the sought-after bounty of Brasan. Yet Irrliam paid an even steeper prize, not only was their army shattered, their capital a smoking ruin; the massacre of Medurubar almost wiped out house Irrliazuir, leaving only aging Taelarios and his infant grandson Thelrion to take up the reign of a shattered realm.\nWith the realm’s might restored, it is now time to enact a long-overdue justice and punish Elizna for their wicked deeds."

While it legitimises our firm hold over the lower Suran plains in the eyes of most other realms in Bulwar, its stipulations have proven increasingly irksome, as they clearly delineate the right to autonomous rule for the republic of Brasan and our other vassal realms.\nAs we have by now more than proven ourselves a worthy overlord capable of shielding our loyal subjects against wanton outside aggression, we should use the garnered goodwill to renegotiate the most troublesome clauses of the treaty that have proven to be a hindrance for our influence over our subjects.

As the gnolls infesting the Šad Sur are no longer holding their greedy paws over the city, it is only a matter of time until Bulwar falls under the sway of a new patron.\nAnd that patron obviously needs to be Irrliam. In pursuit of this goal, several options are discussed in the inner circles of the royal palace. The most respectable one, a diplomatic charm offensive to convince the twelve ruling families of Bulwar of the advantages as a vassal state of Irrliam, has many supporters.

Only then will our faith leave its fractured past behind and speak with one voice, ready to rebuke any malign outside influence and finally bring the heretics scattered across Bulwar into the fold.\nWhether out of genuine conviction or by force of righteous arms, they must bow to our sacred cause.

Their reluctance to accept the authority of priests hailing from beyond their tribes has promoted an unfortunate predilection for insularity and heresy.

All those western traders who wish to purchase the wealth of exquisitely crafted merchandise hailing from the Bulwari heartland or the riches of the mysterious east carried across the Salahad and down the course of the Suran must now perforce deal with us.

The decision where to send him to receive a well-rounded education is a most crucial matter, for it will influence the shape of his future rule for decades or even centuries to come.

With the meteoric rise of Irrliam to the position of undisputed hegemon of the lower Suran in the last decades, its ruler [F37.Monarch.GetName] has claimed that he as the direct descendant of Panoril represents the more senior of the two bloodlines, if only separated by a few minutes, and thus should become the rightful overlord of Sareyand. Their royal marriage to us has solidified this outrageous claim even in the eyes of some of our own vassals, and some obsequious courtiers, plainly trying to curry favour with the Irrliami, openly suggest the abdication of [Root.Monarch.GetName] in favour of [F37.Monarch.GetName] as the proper course of action.\nRefuting this brazen demand would show the rest of Bulwar that we are not the lapdogs of Irrliam, but would certainly give those grasping fools in Medurubar a pretext for invasion."

The sanctimonious Irrliami had not only managed to rein in their unruly menagerie of vassal states, but dealt a devastating blow to the ambitions of gnoll packs infesting the Šad Kuz. While the latter was of course to be publicly lauded, particularly given the not-so-distant plundering of Bulwar by Tluukt, cursed be her name, it presented the merchant princes of Bulwar with something of a dilemma. The precarious balance that had preserved the independence of Bulwar for most of the last century has been irrevocably shattered, and Irrliam has made no secret out of their expansionist agenda.\nOne faction, led by the Ruqašah and Aharmandas families, proposed to bow to the inevitable and negotiate a vassalisation at favorable conditions. Others, the szal-Lekad first among them, refused to countenance any sort of voluntary submission and talked of daring Irrliam to come and try to take the city, speculating - maybe somewhat delusionally - that a coalition of other Cinder Realms would swiftly form to halt the Irrliami advance before Bulwar could fall. Yet many amongst the families appeared to be still undecided regarding the proper course of action, with some displaying a demonstrative indifference, chief amongst them the head of the Gillu-gameš family, who could be observed loudly snoring during some of the council sessions. And then there were the Alukatran, whose representative flitted between the different factions, leaving arguments and controversy in his wake, and when asked how he intended to preserve his family’s fortunes merely sported a cryptic smile.\nAfter a long day and longer night of heated debates, a consensus emerged on how to deal with the threat posed by Irrliam, born from guarded agreement or maybe even exhaustion."

 irrliam.7.d:0 "In the end, the ancient and proud city Bulwar fell not to an open contest of arms, or knelt out of her own volition, but succumbed to treachery from within. While the Council of Twelve, confronted by the spectre of Irrliami acquisitiveness, was paralysed by indecision, one of the families silently chose to break ranks and opened clandestine negotiations with the court in Medurubar.\nThe Alukatran, always rumored to have a particular penchant for skullduggery, intrigue and undercover activities that were best conducted far from the light of day, had decided for themselves that the rule of undisputed first amongst the families and governors of Bulwar, even if that came at the price of an oath of vassalage to the ember crown of Irrliam, was far preferable to their current position as only one amongst twelve merchant prince clans, and not one of the more prominent ones at that.\nThus, during a particularly cloudy night, when the mists rising from the rivers concealed any untoward movement, their skilled agents swarmed the city, opening the gates and barracks to their Irrliami counterparts and made swift but bloody work of any potential sources of resistance stemming from the household guards of the other families.\nCome the morning, the phoenix of Irrliam could be seen fluttering atop the only recently rebuilt walls of the city."

Now one of them, the temple of Eduz-Rakadagš in the city of Bulwar, has fallen firmly into the orbit of Irrliam, a Cinder Realm whose fortunes have been steadily improving over the past decades and who currently stand as the undisputed hegemon of the lower Suran.\nAs Irrliam strives to uphold the legacy left by Taelarios Irrliazuir and serve as the protector of the currently ascendant interpretation of the Sun Cult he helped codify and strengthen over the last centuries, they have reached out to us with a bold proposal. In return for our vassalage and unanimous support in matters of doctrinal disputes, they are ready to use all their might to shield us from any outside threat, be it gnollish fiends or crazed desert nomads.\nNow we have to decide whether this offer is worth our submission, or if we should risk the ire of Irrliam in service of our continued independence."

Mirages of the eye and of the spirit abound, leading even the most grounded individual astray if given enough time. And the Desert Elves and their Mašnsih compatriots have certainly spent more than enough time lost in the depths of the desert to develop the most peculiar delusions. Chief among them is the doctrine disseminated by Jaddar and his disciples, who have twisted the concept of Chosenhood beyond recognition.\nNow, as we rule over the unwelcoming wastes they call home, it falls to us to bring them back into the fold of the faithful and ensure that they find their proper place in the divinely ordained Order, created by Surael himself. But how to best disperse the persistent mirages planted into the minds of these desert-dwellers is a topic of contention amongst the clergy. Some propose a thorough campaign of religious conversion, sending out missionaries to each tribal camp, to each hidden stronghold until the fallacy of Jaddar is but a distant memory in our records. Others argue that the hardy inhabitants of the Salahad respect a show of strength and propose wiping out the most intractable adherents of Jaddar to encourage all others to discard their false beliefs. A small minority questions whether such heavy-handed approaches are suited to win the favour of these independent-minded people. Maybe we should instead hand over the task of administration and conversion to those amongst their ranks who have proven to be devoted servants of the Chosen? Those truly devout who are eager to show their kin the path back into Surael’s Garden?"

The high kašra Taelarios himself was set to bless the union, and a high-ranking member of the Order of Judges had travelled all the way from Azkabar to witness the occasion and officially certify the marriage contract.\nThe assembled worthies of both Irrliam and Birzartanšes, as well as guests hailing both from vassal states and independent neighbouring realms were assembled beneath magnificent silk pavilions erected for this purposes on the grand plaza in front of the main temple, awaiting the arrival of the bridal procession with barely contained anticipation.\nWhen the procession finally began its stately advance along the temple road towards the platform at the base of the temple ziggurat, where [Root.Heir.GetName], the groom-to-be, the high kašra and judge awaited her arrival, it was a spectacular sight comparable only to those legendary wedding ceremonies told in bazaar tales and legends. Keladora, the resplendent queen bride, was clad in a sumptuous yet airy set of layered silken robes in shades of crimson, amaranth, scarlet and ruby, elaborately embroidered and ornamented with argent thread and gemstones, while [Root.Heir.GetName], the royal groom, matched her majestic opulence and wore a sheer silken long tunic of glistening white intricately adorned with gilded thread and a velvet cloak in shades of gold, pale yellow and citrine.\nOnce the ritual exchange of gifts to Surael and mutual dowries was completed, the judge officiated the signing of the marriage contract, negotiated in painstaking detail over the course of the past several months, and the marriage was blessed by high kašra Taelarios, who invoked the divine benediction of Surael Himself with tears of joy and pride visible on his face.\nThe wedding feast that followed the ceremony lasted for three whole days, and even beyond the palace gates, the common people of Medurubar joined in the celebrations, with public banquets and entertainment for all provided by the crown."

As marshal of the Order of the Zenith, it was her task to oversee the systematic eradication of any remaining resistance in the mountain fastness of Azka-szel-Parkellu.\nFoolish as they were, the most stubborn amongst the misguided peasantry eking out an existence in the mountain valleys of the Šad Kuz have sought refuge behind the walls of the notorious seat of the Šebhuliam instead of peacefully surrendering to their rightful new Irrliami overlords.\nYet unlike more than two hundred years ago, this time there would be no misplaced mercy for those who walked the path of heresy. The troops under her command were firm in their convictions, having seen what bitter harvest the surviving ancestors of these fanatics had brought upon the lands of Bahar. Elves and humans alike butchered and tormented simply for staying true to the doctrines of the Council of Brasan.\nThey were utterly determined to draw out the poison of heresy from this wounded land, and key to that goal was lancing those boils of pestilence that were the strongholds of the Šebhuliam.

As for some others, a grim determination to endure whatever fate has next in store for them and their beloved realm was carved into their mien. And finally, on some few faces a cautious hope shone, a hope that this was not the last chapter of Irrliam’s story, but the beginning of an entirely new tale of a glorious rise to heretofore unimaginable heights.\nThe grief, worries and, worst of all, hopeful expectations of the assembled notables of the realm bore down heavily on the untested shoulders of [Root.Monarch.GetName], but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was grimly determined to prove to all of them that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was a worthy inheritor of the noble legacy left by the previous rulers of Irrliam, grand Taelarios himself first among them.\nAs the gilded Ember Crown was finally placed on the new monarch’s head, an expectant silence filled the throne room, for [Root.Monarch.GetName] was about to make [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] first royal proclamation. Would [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] renew the vendetta with Elizna, avenging the slaughter of Medurubar?

Whatever have we done to deserve this?!’\nOne of the more senior butchers, Kenmu, scoffed at this: ‘Haven’t you heard about the massacre of Medurubar? Back then, near the end of the war with Irrliam, our troops butchered every living soul they could get a hold of when they stormed their royal palace, including the royal family itself. Now they’ve come to return the favour!’\nHis disparaging reply prompted Nusaiba, assistant head cook and inordinately proud of it, to chastise him: ‘Stop spouting that nonsense, you’re scaring everyone witless! Good queen Zelaria would never have allowed such an atrocity!’\n‘Allowed?! She ordered the whole damn thing, my grandfather was an aide to one of the generals tasked with taking Medurubar, and he witnessed her orders, loud and clear! You best pray to Surael that the Irrliami are in a forgiving mood when they find us, I know I wouldn’t be!’\nWith that last outburst, a tense silence fell upon the gathered servants, and Haamida was once again lost in her fears and fervently praying for a mercy that the house of Vulzinzuir and all of Elizna in all honesty did not deserve."
