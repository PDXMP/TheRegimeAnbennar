 vt_loot_the_bodies_desc:0 ""Rottenstep, the battle where the tides turned. Despite our valiant fight, human trickery ultimately forced us into a strategic withdrawal. While we were able to kill Prince Jon, they were able to kill both Grom of Dogeater and Brasul of Bonecarver. In many ways, this was where the Greentide failed.\n\nBut that is in the past! Dwelling on defeat would only hold us back. Instead, Rottenstep is a treasure trove of riches left behind out of misplaced respect for the dead. Fortunately, we are not superstitious fools like the others! Let us claim the valuables from that rotten swamp and put them to good use!"\n\n- Collected Sayings of Aâdga Venomtooth, Musings on Rottenstep"

 vt_slave_pits_desc:0 ""It is now time to receive worthy slaves. Through our many raids and wars, we have captured many warriors. While most will be sent to the mines immediately, we need to look to the future. Unlike the goblins, their deaths will be an actual issue and we need to secure a steady supply of human slaves to avoid detrimental consequences. Hence the slave pits.\n\nThe slave pits are made by digging a massive hole in the ground whose only exits are heavily guarded stairways. Within, some basic quarry work takes place, but its true purpose is to serve as a breeding ground for the slaves. They are not treated as harshly as in the rest of our country, but they will have children to replenish their ranks. These children will be trained to work and then are sent onwards to their chosen master."\n\n- Collected Sayings of Aâdga Venomtooth, Sustainable Slavery"

In fact, Clouded Eye’s weakness can only spell its downfall as they betrayed the fundamentals of orcishness by pretending to be human! That is not our way!\n\nBy studying the ruins of human kingdoms and how they failed, we can learn from their mistakes and reform into a stronger society. We equally oppose the savage Dogeater and the decadent Clouded Eye!

 vt_worm_hunt_title:0 "Worm Hunt"
 vt_worm_hunt_desc:0 ""Venomfen was infamous among other clans due to the colossal venomous worms that infested the swamp. Said worms had a diameter of two orcs and could devour entire armies. Just a single nibble could spell death in minutes. In fact for this reason, unlike other parts of Escann, this swamp lacked any villages. I however was able to kill one of the worms and harvest its venom for my own blades, but we need more.\n\nSetting up worm hunting squads should allow us to kill two birds with one stone. By sending our young warriors to hunt the worms, the weak ones will die, but the strong will reveal themselves to be worthy of joining our elite regiments. And each worm hunted down will provide us with a years’ worth of venom for our blades."\n\n- Collected Sayings of Aâdga Venomtooth, Origin of Venomtooth"

We must accept the truth: the worms are going extinct. However, there are other avenues to get poison.\n\nThrough some dealings with the gnolls in Daravan’s Folly, we can procure shipments of Dostanorian and even Kheteratan vipers. These snakes are very deadly. While not as venomous as the worms, the vipers can be kept in pits and fed with very nutritious sustenance like rats and goblins. And as these vipers are much more common and easier to hunt, now all our soldiers can be equipped with poisoned weapons. Let Escann tremble!"\n\n- Collected Sayings of Aâdga Venomtooth, Snakes"

The decaying remnants of a once great empire crumbled like rotten wood. Before long, we stood at the precipice of the world, poised to claim it all for ourselves!\n\nBut this was not to last! Alas, for all our strength, we still allowed ourselves to be blinded by zeal and tribalism. Those weaknesses must be discarded as we cannot hope to rule unless we ourselves are strong.

This time, it will not be sullied by the weakness of other clans or fanatical zealotry. This new path will be one of strength, pure and simple. Perhaps, in time, we will be able to conquer all of Cannor, but for now, our focus is on securing Escann and ensuring stability for our clan."\n\n- Collected Sayings of Aâdga Venomtooth, The Path of Venomtooth"

Azukor, take notes, this is what real orcish honor is, not that pale imitation of human stupidity!\n\nWith a good show of force, we can secure all Rotcleaver lands in the west.

Rip them to shreds!\n\nUpon the ruins of Adenica, a new power rises. Not one built on the deluded ideals of chivalry, but on the harsh truth of victory! As the humans and remaining orcs tremble in fear in the east, we see future slaves to add to our horde and more orcs to sell in Vertesk. None will escape! And in honor of these green fields we seek to claim, we shall declare ourselves Khozrugan. Corintar will fall like its namesake! Unguldavor will be brought to heel!

Thankfully, we have ample experience instilling that fear in many orcs.\n\nSeveral expert slave drivers shall be assembled to whip our rabble into shape to turn the backbone of our new army into a fearsome force.

The Cannorians have apparently found a lost continent to the west and have been using Escanni orcs to man their plantations. We do not care that the weak amongst our kin were enslaved, as that was what we had in store for them as well.\n\nYet this presents a unique opportunity. We have several slave pits containing orcs from defeated clans. Perhaps we could encourage our slaves to have more children so we can sell them in markets down the Alen.

 flavor_venomtooth.1.d:0 "The journey home from Castonath was long and arduous. It was all for nothing, or so it seemed. Despite Venomtooth’s best efforts, the other clans failed to hold the line and Korgus died, taking the dream of an unstoppable Greentide washing over the world with him.\n\nAmong the despondent procession, Aâdga stood out. Tall, lean, and with a glare that could kill, Aâdga rode on her warg with a steely expression. She was there when the orcs first left the caverns as a young warchief ready to prove herself. She planned ambushes, utilized various poisons, and was instrumental in the fall of Balmire. Even in her middle age, Aâdga was full of vigor and cunning.\n\nOne young orc chief, clearly fresh from combat, was visibly holding back his fear as he asked, “Chieftain Aâdga, what do we do now? The Dookanson is dead! He lost to a human girl! What does that say of Dookan, or our purpose? Do the humans have the right to rule over orcs now?”\n\nAâdga glared at the chief as she sharpened her dagger. “Back when I fought alongside Korgus, he killed younglings who doubted him. Some followed Korgus because they believed he was the Dookanson destined to free our god, however, others joined him because they saw the obvious. Humans are weak. Their decrepit kingdoms were ripe for the taking, but no one made a move. Korgus was able to rally all the orcs together, allowing us to match the numbers fielded by the human kingdoms and destroy them. Now, the age of Korgus is over. We no longer need that unity.” She dipped her dagger in a vial of poison before throwing it at a passing deer. The deer collapsed instantly.\n\nChieftain Aâdga looked at the chief again and announced, “The Greentide is over, but the Age of Strength has just begun. We will kill those puny adventurers who rallied against us before getting our revenge on the cowardly orcs of Bonecarver.”"

 flavor_venomtooth.2.d:0 "Orcs from across the lands held by clan Venomtooth gathered in Venomfen. Warriors, laborers, and children all stood around the massive pyre in the village center. This time, the pyre was not burning a body, but an effigy. A stray replica of Korgus burned in place of the body - not out of hatred, but out of respect. As shamans chanted funerary songs to guide Korgus’s soul towards reincarnation, Chieftain Aâdga and her youngest son, Azukor, walked in front of the pyre.\n\nAâdga looked at the crowd and announced, “We have gathered here today to remember the greatest orc of our time, Korgus Dookanson! For thousands of years, we have fought each other in the caverns, blind to the outside world and oblivious to our own potential. Only Korgus could rally all of us together to lead us into this bountiful land we have won for ourselves and our descendants. He showed us how our strength could overcome any challenges and how working as a unified whole makes us far stronger than we could ever be when fighting alone.\n\n“While other clans have forgotten these lessons, we will not! We must march on our enemies surrounding us and show them what true strength is! We will not fall, we cannot fall! Are you ready to set the world ablaze once more?” The crowd roared in approval. Fists were raised in the air as the flames burnt higher.\n\nAzukor looked up at his mother with awe. For her part, Aâdga patted Azukor’s head. “Do not worry, son. I have great plans for you.”"

 flavor_venomtooth.3.t:0 "Forging a New Vision"
 flavor_venomtooth.3.d:0 "What is an orc’s purpose? Traditionally, every orc dreamed of fighting and dying in battle to free their god, Dookan. It culminated in the Greentide, where massive armies of orcs spilled out of the mountains and destroyed the feeble successors of Castanor. However, the Greentide died with Korgus and left many orcs doubting their purpose. Was Dookan really weaker than the human goddess who slew his son? Was it all for naught?\n\nIn Venomtooth, a new vision was formed. The Greentide was made possible by the strength and fervor of the orcs, but was ultimately held back by orcish weaknesses. Its outlook was fanatical, believing that supernatural entities alone could grant victory. Orcs fought with little organization as the many clans competed against each other for the most glory. It was ultimately that discord which the humans could exploit leading to the defeats at Rottenstep and Castonath. The Greentide was an honorable undertaking, but it now belonged to history.\n\nThere will be no grand coalition of clans. That approach was outdated as shown by the adventurers with their organization and technology. All orcs will be unified under one banner: Venomtooth. The clan will succeed where Dookan failed, and become the sole reason the orcs fight. All orcs shall become soldiers of the clan upon reaching adulthood and slaves will toil at home while their masters are out on campaign. Through these changes, Venomtooth will rise above the others.\n\nAs for expansion, the plan is simple. The goblins will fall first, their deaths fuelling the advancement of our realm. Then the adventurers shall be next to fall, supplying us with slaves to wield and knowledge to build up our state. Finally, Bonecarver and Rotcleaver need to be conquered and their people taken as slaves. Instead of wild uncontrolled conquest, Venomtooth will only conquer what it can truly control and this way, in due time, it shall encompass all of Escann."

They were emaciated and tired. An eighth of their number had already died on the march over here, with guards stabbing the fallen to ensure their deaths. The goblins had the look of defeat on their haggard faces. They had fought to keep their only recently gained independence, but it had been all for naught.\n\nAâdga pulled out her dagger and walked over to the table full of bowls in front of the pen. She looked through each one, all different experimental concoctions that needed to be tested out. She dipped the dagger in the first bowl, which contained a mixture of worm venom and hemlock. A goblin was dragged before her, an elderly female with a resigned look in her eyes. Aâdga nicked the goblin’s skin with the blade.\n\nThe goblin started gasping for air, her eyes opening wide as she clutched her throat and looked around. Aâdga scoffed as she watched the goblin slowly suffocate until falling lifelessly to the ground. She looked at a nearby scribe and said, “This concoction is inadequate. The goblin neither experienced drawn out suffering nor a quick death. It is not fit for battle or torture.”\n\nShe got up and looked at the hunters who now formed a circle around her. She laid out several daggers on the table. “Since I have more important things to do with my time, I will need you to test out these different poison mixtures to find out which is the most effective. You will perform several tests with each mixture and observe the effects. Do not worry if you run out of goblins -  we will bring you as many as needed to continue the tests. And remember, I need one potent mixture to coat all our elite vanguard’s weapons with and another for my showdown with Rogier.” She clapped her hands. “Now then, you may begin the trials.”"

A planned invasion of the clan lands of Heartgrinder and Clouded Eye were laid out, plans to hunt every halfling and goblin in the woods were meticulously detailed, and even a list of personal enemies was found amongst the papers.\n\nAzukor walked over to his mother and touched her hand. It was cold, the deep green of her skin already paling in death. Her once proud tusks seemed brittle and weak. He choked back his tears. Tears were for the weak! The strong could feel no sorrow! Aâdga died valiantly fighting the Cannorian devils before they hexed her! Azukor carried his mother to her bed, respectfully covering her remains with a blanket.\n\nHe walked back to the desk and got seated. The enemies of orckind would not wait.

He even practiced with the village animals, though hated how everyone seemed to be angry at him when he killed the cats. When he was a teenager, he had the opportunity to work as an apprentice slave driver, being handed the whip that soon became his favorite tool. He would often be the first to hit human slaves with the lash, but had the restraint to make sure they could continue working. By the time he was eighteen, his request to join the Venomtooth army as a drill sergeant finally got approved. He was not quite sure what his new duties would entail, but the gold payments were too good to pass up.\n\nBork showed up at the training fields and walked up to the two older orcs there. Both were covered in battle scars, and the left tusk of one of them was chipped from a glancing blow by an Ancardian axe. The orc with the chipped tusk handed Bork a whip and explained, “We heard of how you were one of the best slave drivers at that mine in Entelaham. The slaves you oversaw were the most productive and efficient of the whole mining complex. To us, that means you should be great at instilling discipline in rabble. That is why we want you to be a drill sergeant so these unruly younglings properly shape up.”\n\nBork grabbed the whip given to him. Though not as sharp as the one he used at the mines, he smirked as he looked at some conscripts chatting nearby. He walked over to them and whipped them both. “Stop talking and get in formation!”\n\nOver the next few weeks, Bork lashed conscripts for every infraction.

As Walter and his soldiers approached the boat, the rowers stopped, allowing them to board.\n\nWalter approached the lead orc and asked, “What purpose do you have sailing down these waters with a band of orcs?”\n\nThe orc crossed his arms. “What does it look like?” he replied in heavily accented Common. “We’re going to sell these slaves in Vertesk. Is there a toll or something?”\n\nWalter nodded. “There is a toll, but I do not believe orcs would sell orcs into slavery. Pardon my skepticism, but I believe orcs only enslave goblins and humans, not their kin.”\n\nThe orc laughed heartily as he had one of his crew hand over the toll. “Why would we not enslave the strongest weaklings we can? You humans are strange. The Bonecarvers lost the war, so now they are slaves as is their fate.”\n\nWalter was not sure how to respond, so he merely disembarked from the boat with his soldiers after collecting the toll and watched as the galley sailed further downstream. He sent a contingent to shadow their journey, intent on making sure they were up to nothing nefarious."

In the capital of Venomfen, the swamp had been drained, but now it was even more menacing and inhospitable than before, if that was even possible. Human slaves toiled endlessly for their masters while the remaining goblins were tossed into viper pits and used for poison experiments. Among the orcs, all young adults were being drilled outside the city gates in perfect formation, every one amongst them keenly aware that one misstep could be their last.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] pushed the double doors to the palace open and walked in. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] footsteps echoed through the empty halls as he approached the new throne room. Unlike the pale imitation of a human throne in Unguldavor, this throne was forged of pure iron. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] sat upon the throne, which thankfully had cushions so it would not be too painful to sit on.\n\nAnother day, another procession of orders to give. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] gave out several orders to enslave humans found in the woods, burn another goblin village, and send out another raid into Gawed.\n\nNear the end of the group, a young half-orc scribe, the daughter of an orc master and human slave, approached the throne. She bowed and nervously asked, “My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], I was tasked with writing down the history of our realm in an official chronicle. What would you call our kingdom, which surpasses all other kingdoms in Escann?”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], while initially irritated by the half-orc’s audacity to speak unbidden before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], looked at her and announced, “We are the Kingdom of Khozrugan, named after the green fields of Escann. It is our right as the strongest to claim the entirety of them.”\n\nThe scribe wrote it down and left. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] relaxed on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] throne and sighed. The faint sound of shouts and brawls outside accompanied [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] contemplations."

 flavor_venomtooth.11.d:0 "Edith was a descendant of a Cobalt Company soldier, born into slavery and beaten by her master as she worked as a house slave. Despite leading an existence filled with misery, she felt a bond with the children she helped raise and even cried as many did not come back from their service. She secretly harbored hatred and animosity towards her master and the society as a whole that treated life as cheap and easily replaceable. One night, she gathered her courage and snuck into her master’s room where she slit his throat before managing to take his wife captive.\n\nMeanwhile, in the fields, Tuhorn was a slave working in the fields owned by the same master. He was descended from Bonecarver soldiers, but was a slave ever since he was born. His slave driver would beat him and the other slaves for the most minor of infractions. On the same day that his master died, Tuhorn rallied his fellow slaves and stormed the servants’ quarters. They quickly killed the slave drivers before meeting up with Edith and her fellow house slaves.\n\nOver the period of a few years, Tuhorn and Edith created sleeper cells in plantations and mines across Venomtooth. Tuhorn and Edith quickly fell in love, finding common ground in their past as victims of the same cruel society.\n\nAfter years and years of desperate struggle and meticulous planning, a signal was sent out and the sleeper cells activated with the rise of dawn. All across Venomtooth, tens of thousands of slaves rose up, killing their masters, breaking their chains, and continuing the chaos. If they were not stopped, they would surely topple Venomtooth, intending to replace it with a state where orcs and humans are equals.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was able to escape the palace when it was stormed, but this unprecedented impudence of the weakling slaves has filled  [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] with an incandescent rage.

[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] pushed them forward. “By the right of the strong, you two are sentenced to death for treason, blasphemous affection, and defying the place of the weak! Any last words?”\n\nTuhorn glared at [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and shouted, “I do not care about whether you consider us strong or weak! Is it not true weakness to show no mercy and treat all former enemies as slaves? Is it not true strength to show mercy, to have the ability to enact your vengeance but decide against it? If you desire to kill me, then strike me down! I refuse to live in a world where brute force determines who is considered a person and who is not!”\n\nEdith then looked at Tuhorn and said, “Where there is love, there is hope. I refuse to live in a society run by the cruel. This kingdom of yours is not long for this world, [Root.Monarch.GetName]. I just hope that you live to see it all crumble around you.”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned to the executioners and motioned them forwards. Tuhorn and Edith were tossed into the pyre, with guards protecting it until it died the next morning.

This has led to several orcs fleeing into our lands, their hearts filled with fierce zeal for Dookan and hungry for revenge.\n\nWhile Venomtooth as a whole is not very devout, we can use these fanatics as soldiers to fight on the frontlines. Our shamans often adopt a firebrand style of preaching in several villages within former Bonecarver land. Already, several of their warriors have joined the army and many seek a valorous death on the frontlines battling against the adventurers.

Any resistance that the halflings put up is easily crushed by orcish might.\n\nSlowly, the halfling infestation of Escann was being cleared up. As land was made available for orcish settlement, many clanless orcs became the targets of slave catchers. These clanless orcs made up some of the first orc slaves in Venomtooth and became a reliable work force used to cultivate the area.

Aâdga Venomtooth and Rogier “the Exile” Silmuna saw in each other what they despised both about their opposing societies. To Aâdga, Rogier represented the decadent and myth-obsessed humans who fought for ideals and ancient claims instead of using their strength to assert their right to rule. To Rogier, Aâdga represented the brutality of a realm built on the belief that might makes right and practiced slavery, an abhorrent practice to any proud Damerian.\n\nBut after countless wars and skirmishes, their conflict was finally over. Aâdga had Tristan and Rogier taken to her personal torture chamber, where she spent countless nights testing different poisons on goblins and traitors. The lovers were strapped to two separate chairs as Aâdga prepared the daggers. She made sure to coat them both in one of the slower poisons.\n\nShe walked towards them and said, “Your people are now slaves to the strong and your precious Dameria will forever remain a fantasy. So I now give you a choice. If one of you volunteers, I will kill the volunteer and let the other one go. Any volunteers?”\n\nTristan looked at Rogier and saw the pleading eyes of the man he loved. He knew Rogier would not accept it, but he had to protect Rogier as Dameria depended on him. Tristan looked at Aâdga with determination and announced, “I volunteer!”\n\nAâdga was caught off-guard. She approached Tristan and nicked him with her dagger. Almost immediately, Tristan felt searing pain through his blood. His body was in extreme agony, but he gritted his teeth and bared it. He looked at Rogier and said, “My love, I regret nothing! If my sacrifice means you are set free, it is well worth it.”\n\nAfter several agonizing minutes, Tristan finally died. Rogier finally let the tears fall that he had been holding back. Everything he loved was taken from him, his father, his brothers, his sister, and now Tristan.\n\nAâdga cut Rogier’s ropes before nicking him with the dagger. “I said you’d be free to go, not that you’d live.”"
