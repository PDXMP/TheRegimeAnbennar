 bawa_simpat.1.t:0 "Reprieve from Life’s Trials"
 bawa_simpat.1.d:0 "A battle fought. A child lost. A village burned. Such things are commonplace among the Lupulan Rainforest, but the pain from such events weighs on rulers all the same. [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s rule has not been a pleasant one, and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows it all too well. The toll on the [Root.GovernmentName] has been great, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] blames themself for the hardship. Lupulan has deemed nature to be as it is, but why does [Root.GetName] have to cope through such a hardship?"
 bawa_simpat.1.a:0 "Denying a benevolent spirit is a grave error."
 bawa_simpat.1.b:0 "Not every light at night is the torch of a friendly village."
 bawa_simpat.2.t:0 "The Burden of Rule"
 bawa_simpat.2.d:0 "I might write an actual description later, but the gist of it is that your ruler fucking sucks and a seemingly small, kindly spirit offers to ease the burden, in exchange for ‘friendship’"
 bawa_simpat.2.a:0 "Friend or Favor, I appreciate the help."
 bawa_simpat.2.b:0 "Could you make up for what I lack?"
 bawa_simpat.2.c:0 "I rule above my people as I rule over you. Do not overstep your place."
 bawa_simpat.3.t:0 "Nature Beckons"
 bawa_simpat.3.d:0 "The local spirits our tribe/state usually interacts with cordially have shown increased weariness and aggression towards our ruler. One spirit, who commonly shows travellers the path to our capital and dances with the children, had our local hunters wandering in circles for days, demanding they reveal which one had ‘Defied the Great Lizard’. Very Strange!"
 bawa_simpat.3.a:0 "The spirit has gone mad! Expel them from our land, and keep a guard on the children!"
 bawa_simpat.3.b:0 "We trusted them with our children! Something is amiss."
 bawa_simpat.4.t:0 "Who has Power?"
 bawa_simpat.4.d:0 "Ruler walks into an unnatural clearing next to a river with two spirit communers. The clearing is known to be a common meeting locale for spirits, which is who the ruler wants to speak to. A communion between some detailed spirits reveals that some aspect of the ruler’s court holds an energy that is directly antagonistic to Lupulan, and the natural order of things in the rainforest is in danger. Your ruler is a little oblivious and can’t figure out who is causing this."
 bawa_simpat.4.a:0 "I respect the natural order, but I can not allow a tide of spirits to ruin us!"
 bawa_simpat.4.b:0 "On my honor as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], I will root this out immediately."
 bawa_simpat.5.t:0 "Voices in the Leaves"
 bawa_simpat.5.d:0 "Your leader is wandering through the jungle with their retinue, weary from a long day trudging through nature. The spirits have been restless around, occasionally scaring the exhausted troops, or twisting the dirt paths into unrecognizable territory. Suddenly, everyone besides the leader vanishes, and the wind blows the leaves in a pattern that mimics a whisper.\n\nAn offer is raised, promising a sprawling kingdom of opulence and strength. A final unifier of the rainforest, who brings man and spirit to a heel. A lord of two planes, who’s only tithe is to the one who made it all possible.\n\nThe Lady of Stone. The true ruler of the spirit plane.\n\nAll you have to do is shake her hand."
 bawa_simpat.5.a:0 "I know of that place..."
 bawa_simpat.5.b:0 "Where she lies... we must seize it!"
 bawa_simpat.5.c:0 "I have been a fool. I will not be tempted into such falsehoods!"
 bawa_simpat.6.t:0 "The Price"
 bawa_simpat.6.d:0 "With Tlagapatung secured, our ruler stands before a dark, imposing statue. The people of this land whispered the name, ‘Semat Tidakhui’, in regards to this figure. No mistaking it. She is your muse, and now that she has spent her energy and power helping you, it is time to help her.\nInstructions for a rite flash in [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s mind. The legs move without thought, the arms dangle in a pose, as if a puppeteer had finally finished weaving the strings. A strange pulse pushes [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s retinue back, winds from nowhere enveloping around the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nThe energy around [Root.Monarch.GetName] stutters. For a moment, there is a reprieve. The Lady in Stone is weak from the unmarked cycles of being restrained. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has a chance. One chance."
 bawa_simpat.6.a:0 "Sever the bond, and get out of there!"
 bawa_simpat.6.b:0 "Spirits test us in mysterious ways. Prove your loyalty."
 bawa_simpat.7.t:0 "Always a Fool"
 bawa_simpat.7.d:0 "Hahahahhahahahahahha, you fool! Do you think you can just walk away after accepting my gifts, my bargain, and my knowledge? Your freedom was forfeited the moment you stepped foot into this desecrated ground. I am Semat Tidakhui, ruler above even Lupulan himself! You will be my scion to the material wretches, and when you die, I will graft your soul into a new throne!"
 bawa_simpat.7.a:0 "You lost it all, you can’t even speak."
 bawa_simpat.8.t:0 "Better the Evil you Know"
 bawa_simpat.8.d:0 "The Lady in Stone is pleased to have found a loyal subject to her schemes. The opulence and power she promised you when you first met will be secured, but the state you ruled to get to this point now serves her."
 bawa_simpat.8.a:0 "Hail the Ruler of our Planes!"
 bawa_simpat.9.t:0 "What is Power?"
 bawa_simpat.9.d:0 "The muse has continued to assist the rule of your state whenever possible. Your power is cemented, your people cheer your name, and your rivals have gone silent. With such a good partnership between you and your spiritual muse, nothing can stand in either of your way! …Though, it does puzzle [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Who is this muse? A spirit suddenly appears one day, offers to help for nearly nothing, and your kingdom is now flowing in wealth and strength. Interactions between humans and spirits isn’t uncommon, however their relationships are more equal, more symbiotic. This… feels different. Doubt nags at the back of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s head, before it quickly dissipates, the muse’s voice swirling in their ears. “We have done well. It is only a matter of time before what we want is ours. But I must go now. You will speak to me soon.”"
 bawa_simpat.9.a:0 "The Presence is gone before you can respond."
