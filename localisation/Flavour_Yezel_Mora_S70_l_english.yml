 yezel_mora_hattiatia_desc:0 "Hattiatia coils along the roots and bark of the towering Latunga pine like a lattice skirt. As grim as any flora within the Shadow Swamp, the muddy clay roots sport tiny flashes of lush green, a shallow mockery of vibrant tea leaves. Prolonged exposure to the roots causes mild headaches and lethargy. Smoking Hattiatia partially necrotizes the body, causing the mind to wander lucidly while dreaming and the body to align with the Shadow Plane. The plant fetches lucrative prices among the hopeless and the magical. Habitual use weakens vitality, wracks the body with advanced aging, and eventually leads to death, though the swamp trolls’ absurd resilience grants them a notable tolerance to hattiatia's worst side effects."

 #Events
 shadow.1.t: "The Beginning"
 shadow.1.d: ""We are ready, sisters."\nIlfa’s long, long fingers pluck at an akala piece, placing it at the centre of a blossom for ten points. The palm of her other hand rotates the board, and she searches for a counter against herself. She does not look up.\n\n"Yes," says Komina, pacing, her long long braids almost brushing the floor. "We feel it, but we do not say it to one another."\n\n"It is final, once we begin," barks Hireet. She sits soaking her great gouty feet in a saltwater bath, watching Komina.\n\n"Final?" says Ilfa, slowly, still not looking up. "No, never for us. But rare, preciously rare."\n\nHireet nods, flexing her toes. "Our young ones are strong; they have bled the Mengi humans pale these last decades and stand ready to begin the rites. And now we have your man in Simegasa." She gestures at Komina, who smiles beneath her veil. Ilfa finally looks up, frowning.\n\n"Hireet was here earlier, you were not," says Komina, but Ilfa gestures at her impatiently, dismissing the slight, so she continues - "the Simegasan King is mine. He intends to bring his country over to us wholesale."\n\nIlfa cocks her head. "You doubt him."\n\nKomina’s smile spreads beneath her veil. She waves a hand, and there is a clatter of the many bangles on her slender, unblemished arm. "He may succeed, or he may fail. The consequences will feed us regardless."\n\n"We have never been in a better position to overrun the Mengi," repeats Hireet stolidly.\n\n"So we are ready," says Ilfa. There is a moment of silence between the three. Even with their long, long lives, they are not immune to trepidation. It is a big thing they intend to do.\n\nIt is of course Komina who breaks the silence. "A relief, perhaps, to have thrown the dice.""
 shadow.1.a: "The swamp waits with bated breath, what will Simegasa choose?"
 
 shadow.2.t: "Hags Choose"
 shadow.2.d: "The chosen clan hold their breath. That the hags have chosen their town for the honour does not mean much - it does not mean that a scion of theirs will take on the burden. But each new Nail King is like a heartbeat in a time of terror; it is impossible to ignore, and an unusual hush descends over the people in the days it takes the hags to convene.\n\nA different clan each time, for the most part, chosen by a whim the people know better than to question. The hags commandeer a clanhall outside of their own palaces, for it is long tradition that they do not deliberate anywhere but on the neutral ground of their adoptive children, the swamp trolls. There, says Aunty Komina, her enigmatic grin half-obscured by her veil, they can be most objective.\n\nThe ayora smoke has been issuing from the clanhall for days, but on the sixth day it turns a deep, deep black, and the people know the choice has been made."
 shadow.2.a: "As the hags will"
 
 #inform the player they got a province from night coven collapse
 shadow.3.t: "The trolls have retreated to their swamp"
 shadow.3.d: "As quickly as they came and conquered our land they vanished into their swamp, our land is returned to us, ravaged, broken and burned. No doubt they will return for more, with their powers even stronger."
 shadow.3.a: "we must prepare for the coming storm!"

 night_coven_reforms:0 "Night Coven Reforms"
 night_coven_reform_1:0 "Recount The Thirty Doctrines"
 night_coven_reform_1_desc:0 "Let the children of other lands find succour in the warm milk of honourable defeat. Mama Hireet’s legends speak only of victory, and the means needed to seize it. Our virtues are cleverness, tenacity, organisation and ruthlessness. While the lions of the plain doze and preen, we weave webs, build dens and lurk."
 night_coven_reform_2:0 "Grit Our Teeth"
 night_coven_reform_2_desc:0 "Our Wise Three have never promised us ease, only survival and greatness. Every child of our people must one day bear the scars of our adulthood rites, and we will not whimper into obsolescence at the first stage of difficulty. To do what must be done will require loss: the sharp hissing pain of the etcher’s knife in one’s skin."
 night_coven_reform_3:0 "Drain Them Dry"
 night_coven_reform_3_desc:0 "The serval knows when to nip at the wildebeest’s leg, fraying its energy for the chase, and when to leap for the final kill. As our power grows and our resolve strengthens, we begin to hunt in earnest, tearing and biting at flesh until our prey is stripped to the bone. Only thus may we conduct the kind of campaign which destiny now demands of us."
 night_coven_reform_4:0 "Distill The War-Brew"
 night_coven_reform_4_desc:0 "In the time of our grandmothers, our battle-drink ayora lasted a half-day. Our mothers, huddled with Auntie Komina, devised an ayora which could last two days. Now it ferments in the gut for a week or more, and our soldiers return to the fight in record time. Let a warrior do their work while they are young; ayora’s price is one we gladly pay after the fight."
 night_coven_reform_5:0 "Read the Femur"
 night_coven_reform_5_desc:0 "Granny Ilfa has taught us to tear the age-bone out while the heart still beats; in such a way much magic may be wrought, as when reading the rings of a tree. A shaman needs only to taste the bone to know what the foeman has eaten, and with whom, and where this further person now is. Those few who survive into the moments beyond this process die soon enough, knowing beyond a doubt that they have betrayed their friends."

However, landowners in our realm have recently been taking advantage of the fact that the trolls simply don't have the numbers to repel intrusions anymore. This has led to a sustained effort to clear the lands on the edge of the swamp to make them suitable for habitation."

 shadow_horde:0 "Shadow Horde"
 shadow_horde_desc:0 "While the trolls of Yezel Mora are ostensibly under the control of the three Shadow Hags, in reality they tend to leave the running of the horde to the trolls themselves. The hag's main involvement is to choose a new Nail King when the previous one dies. Otherwise they trust the king to rally support, train the military, collect taxes, and keep order. Should the Nail King fail in these tasks however, the hags will deliver swift and cruel punishment, before convening to choose a new ruler."
