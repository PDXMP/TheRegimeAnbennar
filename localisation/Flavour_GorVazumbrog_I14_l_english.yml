 flavour_gor_vazumbrog.1.t:0 "Dauvek Veker Reborn"
 flavour_gor_vazumbrog.1.d:0 "The cheers of victory still echoed in the halls of Gor Vazumbrog, but the work was far from over. Black Orcs had ruled these tunnels for decades, and while their main force had been crushed, remnants lingered—scattered, but still deadly.\n\n'They won't leave on their own' declared Thrain Stonefist, hammer in hand. 'We make them leave - or we make them corpses.'\n\nThe dwarves assembled in groups of six, each squad balanced with scouts, warriors, and one of the iron-gifted smiths for guidance. They didn't just hunt - they tracked with purpose, moving with precision through the unlit tunnels. Their ancestors had once done the same.\n\nDauvek Veker, the Hunters of Deep Monsters, had been more than warriors; they were an order dedicated to purging the Serpentspine of horrors. Where their steel met flesh, no beast or invader survived. For centuries, they'd kept the hold safe before the fall. Now, their memory burned bright in every dwarf who hefted an axe, sword or hammer.\n\nIn the jagged remains of a forgotten orc outpost, one squad found their prey - a squadron of disciplined orcish soldiers.\n\n'For Gor Vazumbrog! For Dauvek Veker!' bellowed Thrain, and they surged forward.\n\nThe fight was brutal, but dwarven steel triumphed. As they stood victorious, Thrain noticed a dwarven-made item between the orc belongings. He knelt to claim the relic - a battered vambrace bearing the sigil of the ancient order.\n\n'They never left us,' he said, lifting it high. 'And we'll never leave their work undone.'\n\nThe tunnels rang with dwarven cheers once more."

 flavour_gor_vazumbrog.2.d:0 "The repopulation of Gor Vazumbrog is underway, and though the work is arduous, the spirit of our people shines bright. Generations have passed since the hold's fall, yet the Titanium Dwarves have answered the call to return. The largest groups hail from Seghdihr, with unmatched determination to return to their ancestral home. Their songs of old bloodlines echo through the half-rebuilt halls.\n\nOthers have come from across the Serpentspine. From Ovdal Kanzad, with their masterful metallurgists; from Ovdal Lodhum, sending hardy miners and administrators; and from Arg-Ôrdstun, their gem crafters and stonemasons already leaving their mark on the new structures. Quite a few have journeyed from Bulwar, having lived among humans on the surface. These dwarves, though strong in spirit, struggle to adapt again to the underground's dim light and confined spaces, but they bring valuable trade connections and fresh perspectives.\n\nMost surprising are those that survived in small settlements in the Serpentspine. These survivors, rare and reclusive, bring tales of endurance and forgotten customs, enriching the hold's rebirth with ancient traditions.\n\nThe work is far from complete, but Gor Vazumbrog's halls are alive once more."

 flavour_gor_vazumbrog.3.d:0 "The resurgence of Gor Vazumbrog is nothing short of extraordinary. Chief among the returnees are the proud dwarves of Verkal Gulan, where generations of Titanium Dwarves found refuge after the fall. For centuries, they dwelled beneath gilded arches, carving out a new life while dreaming of their ancestral halls. Now, they march to Gor Vazumbrog not as exiles, but as heirs reclaiming their legacy.\n\nThe dwarves tracing their ancestry to the titanium hold lead the charge, but others, eager to earn that title, follow in their footsteps with equal determination. Among them stride artisans of unparalleled skill, their hammers eager to echo in their true home, and miners with tools honed by decades in the golden depths. Merchants bring finely wrought wares, eager to reforge the trade networks across the Middle Dwarovar.\n\nTheir professions are as diverse as their origins. From Ovdal Tungr come hardened sailors, their faces etched by salt and storms. They speak of trade routes and maritime travels. Cannor sends its own: proud dwarves from Rubyhold and Silverforge, alongside those from human cities like Lorentaine and Anbenncóst, bringing a blend of tradition and modern ingenuity. Escanni refugees, displaced by the horrors of the Greentide, arrive with grim determination, their resilience a reminder of dwarven endurance. From Rahen, dwarves abandon harimari-governed cities along the Kharunyana and Dhenbasana rivers, seeking refuge and identity in the shadow of the mountain. Their stories blend sorrow with hope.\n\nAmong them strides a runemage from the distant Verkal Ozovar, bringing his knowledge of ancient rites. He speaks of golemancy - an art once lost that our hold used to be known for. Beneath the mountain, stone and will combine anew, and the reborn halls of Gor Vazumbrog resound with clamor once again."

 flavour_gor_vazumbrog.4.d:0 "To [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Majesty, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]\n\nYour Majesty, it is with a grave mix of urgency and deliberation that I, commander Durvin Ironmantle, write to you regarding the Dwarovrod-Gorrod crossroads. Upon your directive, we reclaimed this strategic area to anchor our dominion in the western Serpentspine. The foundations of a citadel were to be laid this fortnight, yet an unexpected impediment arises.\n\nThe area is inhabited by a colony of fungrum — a breed of myconid long known to us as docile scavengers. But the denizens of Azmak Quarry are anything but ordinary. They enact rituals of unnerving complexity, their forms swaying in unison beneath the bioluminescent canopy of their fungal groves. They speak, if one can call it that, of their devotion to an entity they name the Sporeweaver. This being, they claim, slumbers within a cavern deep below the quarry floor.\n\nOur colonists had no trouble in settling nearby areas and even establishing trade with the fungrum. However, any attempt to build advanced structures within proximity of their sanctuary is met with resistance. The fungrum do not resort to violence but to sabotage — tools are consumed by creeping fungi overnight, scaffolds collapse under the weight of unseen decay. Worse, our builders whisper of dreams shared with the myconids: visions of roots entwining their limbs, of spores blossoming from their flesh.\n\nI humbly seek Your Majesty's wisdom. How shall we proceed?\n\nYour loyal servant, Durvin Ironmantle"

Our military engineers evaluated the surrounding terrain and identified a highly defensible site to the north of the quarry. The location is naturally defensible and offers proximity to vital resources, making it an excellent choice for our operations.\n\nConstruction is already well underway. We have begun reinforcing the walls, expanding sleeping quarters for our soldiers, and establishing logistical connections to ensure steady supply lines. The site's strategic advantages promise to bolster our presence in the region and secure our interests effectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the situation with the fungrum has left its mark on the garrison. Despite our officers' efforts to maintain focus, the soldiers have affectionately named the citadel 'Grip Brok,' or Mushroom Fort, a nod to the events that led us here. Morale remains high, and the construction proceeds apace.\n\nYour loyal servant, Durvin Ironmantle"

 flavour_gor_vazumbrog.6.d:0 "To [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Majesty, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]\n\nYour Majesty, it is with measured optimism that I, Commander Durvin Ironmantle, provide an update regarding Azmak Quarry following your command to pursue diplomacy with the fungrum inhabitants.\n\nAs instructed, we approached the myconids with respect, and to our astonishment, they demonstrated a willingness to engage in dialogue. While steadfast in their adherence to what they deem sacrosanct — the seclusion of their sanctuary and the rituals surrounding the Sporeweaver — they proposed an alternative site for our citadel. This location, situated by the more open part of Dwarovrod tunnels, was surveyed by our military engineers and deemed not only viable but exceptional in its defensive potential and access to resources.\n\nIn return for our agreement to respect their customs and avoid encroaching upon their sacred spaces, the fungrum have pledged preferential treatment for our traders passing through the quarry. Furthermore, they have offered to hinder any enemies seeking passage through their domain, providing an unexpected boon to our strategic positioning.\n\nThe fortification efforts are already underway. Interestingly enough, this successful negotiation has struck a chord with our garrison, who now refer to our newfound citadel as 'Hyggrip Brok', or Joyous Mushroom Fort.\n\nI await further instructions but see great promise in this burgeoning alliance.\n\nYour loyal servant, Durvin Ironmantle"

 flavour_gor_vazumbrog.7.d:0 "To [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Majesty, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]\n\nYour Majesty, I write to inform you of the aftermath of our execution of force against the fungrum at Azmak Quarry, as per your command. The fungrum offered little resistance, their response limited to somber chanting in their incomprehensible tongue. Once the fires consuming their fungal groves subsided, our builders began preparations for the citadel's construction without delay.\n\nHowever, troubling incidents have since plagued the endeavor. Several engineers have vanished without a trace, their tools left untouched. Foundations, meticulously laid, have crumbled inexplicably, halting progress and sowing unease among the workforce. Some among our ranks—particularly the more superstitious—now believe the fungrum's chants were not defiance but a warning of instability in the cavern floors. The military engineers concurred that the site was unsuitable, and the construction has been relocated to a new area.\n\nThis episode has left a mark on the garrison's morale. Despite the admonitions of their officers, the soldiers have taken to calling the newfound citadel 'Baelgrip Brok', or Fort of Burnt Mushrooms, a grim reminder of the cost of this venture. I await your guidance as we move forward.\n\nYour loyal servant, Durvin Ironmantle" #â displays badly in a province name

 flavour_gor_vazumbrog.9.d:0 "The council chamber of Gor Vazumbrog was packed, voices bouncing off stone walls as representatives of the three factions debated the future of Dauvek Veker. At the head of the first group stood Thrain Stonefist, a wiry adventurer.\n\n'Hunting monsters is the legacy!' he argued, slamming a dagger onto the table. 'Every forgotten tunnel, every cursed pit crawling with beasts — that's where we belong. What use is reclaiming other holds if our backyard itself isn't safe?'\n\nAcross from him, General Magda Ironmarch crossed her arms, her gleaming armor reflecting the lantern light.\n\n'Your precious beasts won't march on our gates, Thrain,' she countered, her tone sharp. 'The Black Orcs will. We should be fortifying, building defenses, and projecting our power through the Dwarovrod. Dauvek Veker weren't just hunters—they were warriors. Let's act like it.'\n\n'And let the tunnels rot?' Thrain shot back. 'What happens when the things in the dark grow bold because we were too busy building walls?'\n\nMagda sneered. 'You'd waste resources chasing shadows while enemies at our doorstep regroup!'\n\nAt the edge of the room, Master Lorek Runehand, a tinker and scholar, coughed politely.\n\n'If I may—'\n\n'No, you may not!' Thrain and Magda snapped in unison, glaring at each other.\n\nThe argument raged on, neither side willing to yield, each convinced they carried the true spirit of Dauvek Veker. Meanwhile, the shadows beyond Gor Vazumbrog's gates crept closer, indifferent to dwarven squabbles."

 flavour_gor_vazumbrog.10.d:0 "The great hall of Gor Vazumbrog was silent as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] entered, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] cloak sweeping the stone floor. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] armour, forged of titanium and steel, gleamed in the candlelit hall. The factions' representatives - Thrain Stonefist, General Magda Ironmarch, and Master Lorek Runehand - stood at attention, their earlier argument simmering beneath tense expressions.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] raised [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand. 'Enough.' [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] voice carried the weight of the mountain. 'We are one hold, one people. I will not see the legacy of Dauvek Veker splintered by pride.'\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] turned to Thrain first. 'Stonefist, your passion for exploration is undeniable. You and your scouts will lead expeditions into the depths, ensuring our tunnels are safe and mapped.'\n\nTo Magda, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] said, 'Ironmarch, your discipline and strength are the bedrock of our defenses. You'll command our warriors and engineers to fortify the hold and drive our enemies from the Dwarovar.'\n\nFinally, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looked to Lorek. 'Runehand, you and your scholars will preserve our past and shape our future. Study the relics we recover, rebuild the wisdom we've lost.'\n\nThe three representatives exchanged glances, reluctant but thoughtful. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stepped forward.\n\n'Each of you carries a vital part of Dauvek Veker's legacy. Together, you will forge it anew. Remember the words.'\n\nThrain broke the silence first. 'Titanium does not break.'\n\nMagda nodded firmly. 'Nor bend.'\n\nLorek smiled faintly. 'Nor shatter.'"

 flavour_gor_vazumbrog.11.d:0 "The chamber buzzed with energy as Lorek Runehand tapped his rune-inscribed staff against the stone floor. Around the table sat scholars with ink-stained fingers, engineers clutching blueprints, and runesmiths with fragments of crystalline components laid out before them.\n\n'Gentledwarves,' Lorek began, a broad grin spreading beneath his meticulously braided beard, 'for the first time in centuries, we have the resources and unity to dream big. The golems of old were not merely tools—they were the very lifeblood of dwarven progress. Let us reclaim that glory.'\n\nAn engineer unrolled a schematic, revealing a massive foundry complex with interconnected assembly lines. 'The key is scalability,' she said, tapping the diagram. 'If we cast and forge bodies in standard sizes, we can reduce costs without compromising durability.'\n\n'Efficient,' Lorek mused, stroking his beard. 'But we need data crystals — more than we can currently produce. Without them, our golems would be nothing but hollow hulks.'\n\nA runesmith leaned forward. 'We could focus on refining runic drives. If we simplify codified instructions, the initial models could be task-specific—miners, guards, even builders.'\n\n'And the power source?' a scholar interjected. 'Damestear cores are potent but volatile. Binding an elemental might offer more stability.'\n\n'But would it respond predictably?' Lorek countered, his eyes gleaming with curiosity. 'Imagine a rebellious elemental in a titanium body!'\n\nLaughter rippled through the room. They were far from agreement, but the air was thick with excitement. For the first time since Aul-Dwarov, the dream of large-scale golemancy felt tangible."

 flavour_gor_vazumbrog.14.d:0 "They laughed and called us mad. Insane for even considering attempting to rebuild in the most ravaged and cursed area of the Serpentspine, where the dragon's wrath left its marks, and dark magic still lingers like a festering wound. They warned us that the effort required to rebuild would be tremendous, if it was even possible at all. They feared that the dragon-scarred tunnels beneath our hold would collapse, crushing our buildings and burying our settlers alive. They whispered of monstrous creatures emerging from the Wound, ready to hunt down anyone who dared to return. And they trembled at the thought of the ancient magic seeping from the ruined Vaults into our walls.\n\nAnd they were right in all of this, but they were also wrong. We did not choose this fate – we have simply returned. Home."

Gor Vazumbrog of old followed a clear tradition: leadership drawn from the ranks of the general staff, ensuring that those who guide us have proven their skill in battle. Captain [Root.Monarch.GetName], who bravely led us here, is a great leader for a company, yet even he, with his unflinching honesty, acknowledges that the burden of ruling a nation may demand qualities beyond his ken.

 flavour_gor_vazumbrog.20.d:0 "The grand plaza of Gor Vazumbrog was a spectacle of triumph. Hundreds of dwarves filled the square, eager to hear the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s proclamation. Overhead, banners bearing the sigils of reclaimed glory swayed gently in the cavern draft. At the raised dais in the centre stood [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] figure radiant in ancestral armour, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ceremonial sword resting against the small balustrade, as he begun to speak.\n\n'Today, we honour the blood and sweat—'\n\nThe words froze in the air as the fires dimmed, their flames guttering inexplicably. A soundless tension gripped the chamber, a suffocating stillness that pressed against every chest. Then, without warning, the eastern gallery shattered inward, masonry exploding in a cascade of dust and debris.\n\nFrom the void beyond, she emerged. Shrouded in a fleshy purple veil that seemed to writhe like living mist, the dragon moved without a sound, her monstrous form obscured, yet unmistakable. Her double lower jaw parted, revealing rows of impossibly long fangs that glistened like wet obsidian. The sickle-shaped claws on her toes and wingtips glinted, slicing through the air with a predatory grace.\n\nThe hold's bells rang out, but too late, their peals drowned by chaos. In the erupting panic soldiers scrambled to form ranks, but their movements were frantic, disordered. The dragon surged forward, her clawed wings slicing effortlessly through the first ranks, leaving bodies split and armour crushed. Her veil billowed, and where it brushed the dwarves, they faltered — eyes wide, weapons slack, terror flooding their faces.\n\nThe poisonous miasma came next, seeping from her jaws in an eerie silence. It crept through the chamber, invisible at first, until the first dwarf collapsed, choking. Then another. And another. Then a soldier in one of the back lines lowered his axe, staring blankly at the blood-soaked stone. His lips moved, silent, before he screamed — a raw, guttural sound — and lunged at his comrade howling 'Traitor!' and swinging wildly. The other dwarf barely managed to block, his face twisted in confusion. Around them, the chaos spread like fire.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] leapt from the dais, sword raised high, but the dragon moved too quickly. Her claws tore through the masterwork armour as if it were parchment. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] fell, lifeless, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body crumpled at her feet.\n\nWith one last sweep of her massive form, the dragon tore through the hold gates and disappeared into the darkness of the Serpentspine. The city lay shattered, its people broken. The bells, late and feeble, tolled in the distance, a mournful echo of a hold undone."

Her wrath has left our once-proud province in ruin. The shrines to our ancestors, to heroes whose deeds shaped our very bloodline, have been shattered and defiled.

The dragon has been seen moving through the region, and the devastation wrought by Her has opened new passageways. It seems our enemies have wasted no time in exploiting them.\n\nI have personally observed multiple goblin bands moving through the newly fractured corridors. Their numbers are hard to estimate due to their erratic movements, but I would place them at no fewer than twenty to thirty thousand in total, divided into small raiding groups. These goblins are poorly equipped but numerous enough to pose a danger to any isolated survivors or lightly defended outposts.\n\nMore troubling is the sighting of an orc warband. This group is far more organised, numbering approximately nine thousand warriors, heavily armed and seemingly scouting for weaknesses in our defences. Their presence is a grave concern.\n\nOther scouts have reported seeing stranger creatures emerging from the depths - shadows with too many limbs, whispers that move like smoke. I am skeptical of these accounts, as fear and exhaustion cloud many minds, but I include them for completeness.\n\nReconnaissance in the region is incomplete; the unstable terrain and constant threat of attack hinder our efforts.

Rescue efforts continue, but progress is slow and perilous, given the instability of the remaining structures.\n\nThe devastation extends to critical infrastructure. The central aqueduct has been severed, cutting off water to half the hold. The state forge lies in ruin, limiting the recovery of our already thin tool supplies.

Six thousand strong we were, each soldier armed with the finest weapons our forges could provide, each one ready to lay down their life for the cause.

Our muskets, our cannons, all useless. In mere minutes, She reduced our mighty host to ruin. The screams… I cannot describe them. I will not.

Beneath the cavernous roof of the High Anvil Chamber — one of the few spaces left relatively unbroken — a crowd of somber dwarves gathered. At the heart of the assembly stood the newly elected [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], clad in gleaming blacksteel ceremonial armor engraved with mourning runes. The intricate carvings spoke of resilience, but their cold brilliance seemed to echo the chill in the chamber.\n\nAn empty bier held no body, only the crown of the fallen [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and a tattered shard of his banner. Behind it, a slab of stone, cracked and blackened, symbolized the hold itself, carved with jagged cracks to mirror its wounds.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] stepped forward, his voice low and rough. 'Today, we bury what we cannot lay to rest. Our leader gave his life defending our home until his last breath. Our hold, our fortress, our lifeblood, lies broken, as he does. Yet even the stone that crumbles can become a future foundation.'\n\nThe crowd stood motionless, breaths shallow, the flicker of torches casting fleeting shadows on the chamber walls.\n\n'We are left with stone fractured and kin lost. But Gor Vazumbrog will rise again from the ashes — for we are forged in the fire, tempered by loss, and unyielding.'\n\nHe lowered his gaze to the cracked stone slab and bowed his head.\n\n'Titanium does not break.'\n\nThe crowd echoed the words like a sorrowful chorus.\n\n'Titanium does not break.'"

To the red-skinned ogres, they were nothing more than desperate traders - strangers from across the world, seeking tin to mend their distant forges.\n\nThe true prize, however, lay deep in the Oni vaults: Korashi. A black, anti-magic mineral, never bartered, never shared. Legends whispered of its power to shatter spells, to silence even the wildest sorcery. The hold, splintered by the toxic magic from the Wound needed it badly.\n\nNegotiations were a farce. A distraction. While their merchant front drank and haggled over worthless tin, three cloaked figures slipped past guarded gates. The Oni stored Korashi like sacred relics, their vaults wreathed in dim firelight. The Hunters worked fast, cutting open lead-lined crates, replacing weight with stones. Not much - just enough to learn. Just enough to bring back.\n\nDawn saw the caravan leave, their wagons no heavier than before. The Oni laughed at the poor fools who had overpaid for tin. The dwarves kept their grins hidden.

His reflection shimmered in the polished brass of the gate, a Titanium Dwarf born in exile, finally coming home.\n\n'It's as grand as they said,' he murmured, his voice carrying both reverence and disbelief.\n\nThe guards smiled and waved him closer. 'Welcome back, kinsman! You've journeyed far.'\n\nHe stepped forward, chest swelling with pride. The air was crisp, heavy with the scent of stone and deep-earth moss.\n\nThen came the sound. A low growl, a rush of wind-like movement. Before anyone could react, the shadows erupted.\n\nThe Drakon struck with terrifying speed, a sleek blur of scales that wove effortlessly through the jagged stalagmites. Its maw clamped down on Foldan, teeth piercing through leather and bone as though they were paper.\n\nHe screamed, reaching out toward the gates as the beast wrenched him into the darkness.

The crowd lined every avenue, their faces alight with hope and fear, throwing flowers and shouting blessings as if to ward off the darkness the army was destined to face. Each step of the procession was a symphony of discipline - armoured boots striking stone in perfect rhythm, a sound that reverberated through the hold halls like a heartbeat.\n\nThis was no mere war band. The expedition had been forged from the finest steel of the hold: Monster Hunters hardened by decades in the Serpentspine's depths, battle-scarred veterans bearing stories etched into their flesh, and masterful mages and runesmiths wielding the arcane with unmatched precision. At their head rode Commander Khadan Stonebreaker, young but tempered, a prodigy whose untested ambition burned as brightly as the runes etched into his shield.\n\nBehind them stretched an endless train of supply caravans, groaning under the weight of provisions, tools and weapons. But as they approached the Wound, the jubilant air faded.\n\nThe twisted pit loomed ahead, a gaping scar upon the earth. The air grew thick, each breath an effort, the acrid scent of tainted magic stinging their lungs. Sickly purple light bled from jagged rocks, casting wavering shadows across their path.\n\nA sense of foreboding washed over the expeditionary force as they entered the tainted land, their footsteps no longer echoing but falling silent against the eerie stillness. Khadan raised a hand, halting the army. Only a murmur could be heard, runesmiths muttering protective spells under their breath, trying to shield the group from the malevolent forces. The miasma hung like a noxious curtain, twisting and coiling in on itself as if alive with some malevolent purpose. With a determined nod, Khadan unsheathed his sword, raising the blade high in the air. 'Titanium does not break!' he declared, his voice firm."

Our supply lines, stretched thin in anticipation, received no requests for aid from the depths of the Wound. Not a single plea for water or food reached us. We were expecting a steady stream of messengers to return, but only a handful ever did.\n\nOne young dwarf came back, his once-handsome face now twisted and distorted beyond recognition, screaming and thrashing with a fever that consumed him. His last words were of 'the eyes' that haunted him in the darkness. A whole squad of monster hunters returned seemingly unscathed, their faces twisted into maniacal grins as they regaled us with tales of their triumphs. But the next day, they were all found hanging from the rafters in the main plaza. But it was the return of Commander Khadan Stonebreaker that sent shockwaves through our hold.\n\nHis attendants, gaunt and hollow-eyed, carried him forward, their hands trembling under the weight of his mangled form. His armor, corroded and brittle, clung to him in broken shards, his flesh beneath blackened and fissured like ore left too long in the forge.\n\n'The deep veins… the stone remembers…' Khadan rasped, blood bubbling from his lips.\n\nThe only respite our physicians could offer was a cold bath, which proved to be an agonising deathbed. It was only after his last breath, as the [Root.GetClergyName] tended his body, that we realised the true extent of his sacrifice.\n\nBeneath the layers of fused metal and leather, his very skin had been etched with deep, unnatural patterns - runes of unknown origin, carved along his ribs and spine. When studied, the cuts formed a map - a map of safe passages and areas untouched by the toxic magic of the Wound. The stone under Gor Vazumbrog, thought cursed and impenetrable, had fractures, hidden seams where expansion could proceed safely. With this knowledge, the hold could now press deeper."

At first, they were subtle - a faint shudder beneath the stone floor. The forge's master smith, Goren Bronzebrow, dismissed it as a quirk of deep earth. But within days, the tremors grew violent. Support beams groaned, and molten slag spilled from tilting crucibles.\n\n'Pull the workers out!' Goren bellowed, his voice barely cutting through the chaos. Dwarves scrambled, abandoning half-finished blades and glowing ingots as the forge floor cracked beneath them.\n\nThe ground gave way with a sickening lurch, pulling the central hearth into the earth. Dust and sparks erupted as the forge sank unevenly, leaving a gaping pit in its place. Surveyors, summoned to the scene, were baffled. The bedrock had appeared flawless - solid and unyielding. Yet now it crumbled as if hollowed from below.\n\n'The earth turns against us,' muttered a soot-streaked apprentice, clutching a warped hammer. Whispers of curses and forgotten tunnels filled the hold.\n\nGoren stood at the edge of the pit, fists clenched. 'We'll rebuild,' he said through gritted teeth.

You'll doom us all.'\n\nThe merchant scoffed. 'Superstition! This weapon could make a lord of any buyer! Shall we start bidding?'\n\nAs he spoke, the air grew heavy. The hum of conversation gave way to silence, then to murmurs—unfamiliar voices threading through the crowd. Whispers, than silence again.\n\nA child screamed, and the spell broke. The crowd surged as panic spread, the whispers rising into a shriek.\n\nThe first to fall was crushed beneath a wagon as its oxen bolted, eyes rolling in terror. Others stumbled, trampled in the chaos. The merchant clutched the dagger, his face frozen in terror as the whispers wrapped around him, louder now, accusing and demanding.\n\nBy the time the hold garrison arrived, the marketplace was a wreck of broken stalls and bodies.

Hours later, the pillar began to groan. The sound wasn't the usual settling of stone but a low, unsettling creak that seemed to pulse, irregular and wrong.\n\nBy the next day, cracks webbed the cavern floor. Engineers scrambled to diagnose the issue, their calculations showing no flaw in design. But the pillar itself began to shift—warping as though under immense unseen pressure.\n\n'It's cursed,' murmured a miner, his voice low but carrying. Others nodded, exchanging wary glances. Some whispered about ancient grudges buried deep in the rock, forces that resented the intrusion.\n\nThe overseer dismissed the rumours as nonsense, yet the pillar twisted further, the runes upon it fading as though drained.

Ungrim's hammer struck true, splitting the last layer of stone. A rush of warm air spilled into the tunnel, carrying a foul, sulfurous stench. He gagged, pulling back.\n\n'What's that?' muttered Norbûn, his apprentice.\n\nUngrim didn't answer. Beyond the breach, a cavern yawned open, its walls slick and glistening as if sweating. Dim, green light pulsed in its depths, casting unnatural shadows.\n\n'Careful,' Bella warned, stepping forward. She held a lantern high, its flame flickering in strange, erratic patterns. The others crowded behind her, reluctant to look but unable to turn away. Something moved within the cavern—slow, deliberate. A faint, rhythmic scrape echoed, like claws dragging over stone.\n\n'Back to the lift,' Bella ordered, voice tight.\n\nAs the miners retreated, the tunnel groaned, the stone beneath their boots softening. Norbûn screamed as his leg sank into the floor, his flesh sizzling. Ungrim grabbed him, but the ground buckled, and both were swallowed whole.\n\nBella stumbled into the lift with the last survivor, slamming the lever. As they ascended, she glanced down. The cavern glowed brighter, the scraping sound growing louder. When they reached the surface, she gasped for air, gripping the edge of the platform.\n\n'What did you see?' a foreman asked."

The light revealed a cavern larger than any recorded, its walls smooth and etched with faded carvings of warriors, triumphs, and oaths.\n\n'This… this isn't on the maps,' murmured Adûn, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\n'It's not in the records either,' Thohga replied, her words heavy.\n\nAs they ventured deeper, the lantern's glow revealed rows of skeletons, perfectly aligned. Each lay clutching a rusted weapon, their armor bearing sigils none of them recognized. Thohga knelt by one, tracing the markings on its chestplate - a hammer crossed with a jagged rune.\n\n'They're dwarves,' she whispered, the words like ash in her mouth.\n\n'But not ours,' Adûn added, his tone uneasy.\n\nThe air felt heavier, the silence pressing on their ears. Superstitious mutterings rippled through the group. Thohga stood, jaw clenched.\n\n'Whatever they were, they fell here. And we shouldn't disturb them.'\n\nThe miners hesitated, their tools motionless. Finally, Thohga spoke again.\n\n'Seal it,' she ordered. 'They deserve their rest.'\n\nThe miners left the cavern in silence, but unease followed them. What lay beneath Gor Vazumbrog wasn't just stone."

The air was heavy with age, carrying the faint tang of rust and the subtle sweetness of long dried incense. In the flickering torchlight, the final resting place of Krummul Orcslayer revealed itself.\n\nCarved from black basalt and veined with shimmering threads of titanium, the sarcophagus dominated the room. Intricate reliefs adorned its surface, depicting Krummul's greatest victories. One panel showed him cleaving through orcs with his greatsword Setzunklufa, while another captured his battle against the Ancient Deep Crows. Around the chamber, murals depicted his Monster Hunters standing alongside hulking titanium golems, as they held the line against tides of goblins. This particular detail seized the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s attention, reminding [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim] how much has been lost.\n\nSetzunklufa rested on a dais beside the sarcophagus, untouched by time. Its enormous blade, forged from steel laced with mithril, shimmered faintly reflecting torchlight. The [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] knelt, bowing [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] head in silent respect.\n\nAs [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] rose and turned to leave, the murals seemed to burn brighter in [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind's eye. Inspiration surged through [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim] - vision of a stronger, united Gor Vazumbrog, its defenders echoing the honor and courage of Krummul's age. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] current dominion seemed like a pale shadow, compared with the heights of ancient empires.\n\n'What was ruined, can be rebuilt. What was lost can be regained.'

[Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] stopped, torchlight flickering against [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] worn features, and turned to [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] entourage.\n\n'One more,' [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] urged, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] steely gaze meeting each weary pair of eyes. 'Hehogrim wouldn't turn back.'\n\nGrumbles rippled through the company, but they followed. They moved deeper into the earth, the air growing cooler and thick with mineral tang. Then, the lead scout halted abruptly, torch raised.\n\nBefore them, the tunnel opened into a cavern of breathtaking enormity. Mithril veins snaked from the ground like the roots of a colossal tree, twisting and coiling upward, their shimmering light casting the chamber in a silvery-blue glow.

The faint sound of dripping water echoed like a melody, blending with the low hum of the mithril.\n\nThe [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] knelt, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes reflecting the metallic glow. 'Hehogrim led us here,' [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] whispered with reverence. 'This is his blessing.'\n\nOne of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] officers stepped closer, awe etched into her face.

Lisban's mithril breastplate bore deep gouges where claws had raked it; the shimmer of the rare metal was dulled by grime and dried blood. Behind her, Hjal carried their lantern high, its light revealing the hollow-eyed stares of their companions. Their numbers had dwindled - too many left behind, too many swallowed by the shadows.\n\nBut here, the chamber opened before them, untouched by the chaos that had claimed the others. The walls were unnaturally smooth, as if sculpted by hands far more precise than any mortal artisan. At the chamber's center rested a pedestal of raw, uncarved granite, untouched by tool or time.\n\nAnd atop it rested the Sphere.\n\nLisban stepped closer, her boots scuffing against the flawless stone floor. The Sphere gleamed with an almost liquid sheen, its surface flowing like silver, shifting with faint, restless runes. The hum it emitted was barely audible, but she felt it in her chest - not a sound, but a vibration in her bones, steady and unyielding, like a second heartbeat.\n\n'What is it?' Hjal asked, his voice hushed.\n\n'Something old,' she murmured, reaching out.\n\nHer fingers brushed the surface, cool and smooth, and the hum deepened. The stone beneath the pedestal rippled outward like water, forming perfect concentric rings. Lisban gasped, pulling her hand back, but the Sphere remained still, as if waiting.\n\n'It shapes the stone,' Thorrik said, awe in his voice. 'The carvings, this chamber - it's all its doing.'\n\nThe group exchanged wary glances. Lisban's hand hovered over the Sphere again, this time deliberate. She could feel it responding, the hum syncing with her pulse.\n\n'We can take it,' she said, her voice steady. 'Use it.'\n\nNone argued. Whatever dangers lay ahead, the Sphere was a gift."

The constructs moved steadily where the dwarves could not, immune to the miasma's corrupting touch.\n\nThe chamber they entered was vast and suffused with an unnatural stillness. At its centre, rising from a gleaming titanium block, loomed a blackened anvil; its obsidian surface so dark it seemed to drink in the light of their lanterns. The runes carved upon it rippled in a restless, shifting darkness. The anvil exuded a strange silence, a void that pressed against their ears, muting even the sound of their own footsteps.\n\nOdur signaled a golem forward. Its heavy, deliberate stride broke the tension, but as it approached the forge, is seemed to wind down. When it reached out to touch the structure, the glowing core within its chest dimmed to nothing. The golem halted mid-step, its frame collapsing lifelessly with a muted hollow clang.\n\nGrûaim whispered hoarsely, 'What in the stone's name...?'\n\n'No enchantment can survive this thing,' Balga said, staring at the forge.\n\n'Half of us didn't survive reaching it,' Odur muttered.

Archways emerged, each more ornate than the last, framing doorways to future chambers.\n\nEvery dwarf watched in awe as staircases coiled into existence, their steps perfectly even.

The ground began to tremble as Morzad's confidence faltered. Shadows flickered in the lantern light, and whispers seemed to echo from the stone itself. A cold wave of fear struck him.\n\n'Stop!' Morzad gasped, his voice shaking. His shame and panic poured into the Sphere like poison. The ground roared in protest, solid stone turning to a fluid, shifting mire. The cheers became screams as tunnels collapsed, homes sank, and dwarves were swallowed by the churning stone.\n\nMinutes stretched into an eternity before the chaos ceased. The stone settled, leaving behind silent, hollowed-out halls, eerily pristine as if the tragedy had never occurred. No sign of life remained — only empty homes and tunnels carved in perfect symmetry, mocking their loss.\n\nThe Sphere lay silent amid the ruins, its glow dim, as the echoes of the drowned settlement lingered in the still air."

 flavour_gor_vazumbrog.731.d:0 "The Vaultwardens gathered around the Anvil of Unmaking, their faces half-lit by the void-light pulsing from its obsidian surface. The experiment was simple - dismantle the magic woven into a centuries-old runeblade. As the anvil's field took hold, the blade's enchantments frayed like threadbare cloth, dissolving into nothing. A triumph.\n\nThen Master Runmar staggered. He blinked, hands shaking as he touched his own chest, confusion settling in his eyes. 'Where… where am I?' he muttered. At first, they thought he was merely lightheaded, but then his gaze turned vacant. He looked at them as though they were strangers.\n\n'Runmar, it's us,' one of the scholars urged.\n\nThe name meant nothing to him. He stumbled back, looking at his own hands as if they were alien things. 'I-' He faltered. A pause. Then, voice brittle as crumbling parchment, he whispered, 'Who am I?'\n\nPanic set in. They dragged him from the Anvil's radius, but the damage was done. The man who had spent decades mastering the arcane now could not recall a single rune. His past, his knowledge, his very self - all unmade."

This was their boldest experiment yet - an attempt not just to unmake magic, but to reshape it.\n\nThe process was agonizingly slow. The anvil's effect, usually swift and merciless, struggled against the very nature of damestear. Hours passed as its brilliance dulled, its essence drained thread by thread. The runes lining the chamber flared under the strain, sigils of containment flickering as waves of disrupted magic threatened to break loose.\n\nThen, at last, the damestear darkened. No longer did it glisten with arcane potential - instead, it became something other. When tested, it did not conduct magic but consumed it, draining spells, unraveling enchantments, leaving nothing in its wake.\n\nYet the process remained inefficient, unstable, and perilously expensive. Even the researchers, shielded behind layers of wards, felt their own thoughts grow muddled in the Anvil’s presence. And still, they knew - if refined, if mastered - this discovery could change everything. The promise was undeniable, and everyone understood what it meant for the hold."

Its design is both austere and regal - its band subtly tapered, as if sculpted by an artisan who understood the fine balance between elegance and intimidation. The surface is inlaid with veins of deep silver that twist into precise, geometric dwarven runes of control and harmony. When worn, the metal is unnaturally cool at first, sending a slight shiver down the spine before adjusting seamlessly, as if it has always belonged there. The fit is perfect - unquestionably so - as if the Crown does not accommodate the wearer, but rather, the wearer molds to the Crown.\n\n The Crown does not shout its power. It does not need to. It whispers, reinforcing words with subtle, undeniable gravity. Commands take on an air of absolute certainty, their edges sharpened, their weight impossible to ignore. Those who stand before the wearer find hesitation slipping away, their resistance unraveling, as if second-guessing is a foreign and foolish notion.

A hub of transportation, trade, and communication that connected every corner of the Dwarovar. Though those days are now distant memories, the strategic position of this hold still holds great importance. If we are to entertain any thoughts of venturing further north, it is imperative that this vital location is secured by a friendly force. Our staff recommends a surgical strike led by an elite expedition company to regain control of Er-Natvir for the dwarves."

This often resulted in comical scenes of mismatched and makeshift equipment, leading to many jokes about emulating the orcish fashion to better blend in while hunting them. However, as the order becomes more professionalised, there are calls for standardisation. The latest proposal includes a sleek armour design made from the impenetrable scales of drakons and reinforced with sturdy iron webs harvested from Hul-Jorkad skitterers.

The guards tasked with protecting the perimeter of the hold sometimes vanish suddenly and inexplicably. As the mining teams delve deeper, encounters with broken remnants of dangerous magic become more and more common. And to make matters worse, what used to be the lower levels of the hold still lies in ruins, a treacherous pit filled with toxic miasma; a stark reminder of the desolation that She brought.

If they cannot come to a consensus on their objectives, we will assign them specific goals. Our efforts to recolonize Serpentspine are ongoing, and our settlers require protection.

But nowadays, they are a rarity and the few that remain are often old and malfunctioning. Although the knowledge of golemancy has not been entirely lost, many specialised runic scripts used to control them have been forgotten, and it's challenging to find a dwarf with practical knowledge. Restoring the facilities will require considerable effort from the state."

 gor_vazumbrog_legacy_of_aul_dwarov_desc:0 "As a part of Aul-Dwarov, Gor Vazumbrog was often called upon to advise on matters concerning military strategy and the protection of the Dwarovar. We were responsible for safeguarding ancient texts, artifacts, and new inventions deemed too risky for public use but too valuable to destroy outright. Now, the Vaults have been breached, and chaos has spread throughout the Serpentspine - including Amldihr. It is up to us to restore order, starting with the heart of the Dwarovar."

 gor_vazumbrog_our_legacy_title:0 "Our Legacy"
 gor_vazumbrog_our_legacy_desc:0 "Once we were hailed as the Vault Hold, safeguarding everything deemed too perilous by Aul-Dwarov. But when Aul-Dwarov crumbled, we were left to watch helplessly as a flood of refugees poured out from the Serpentspine, hold after hold falling like dominoes.\n\nOnce we were the western shield of the Segbandal, our strength and courage standing strong against any threat. But betrayal and complacency brought it down too, leaving behind only scattered remnants who cared only for their own safety, too scared to even leave their holds.\n\nNow it is time for us to forge our own destiny."
 gor_vazumbrog_our_legacy_ct:0 "We will institutionalise our Titanium Orders and provide them with a clear purpose."

 gor_vazumbrog_legacy_of_segbandal_title:0 "Legacy of Segbandal"
 gor_vazumbrog_legacy_of_segbandal_desc:0 "Our long history together makes it difficult to separate the glory of our shared accomplishments from the mistakes of the past. The stranglehold on resources that prevented us from reclaiming Bogig Vazumbrog. The treachery of the Seg Band that resulted in the destruction of our sister hold. Many of our people grew up in Seghdihr and recall both the shelter they were given - as well as the feeling of being second-class citizens.\n\nYet before it was throttled by Seghdihr's greed, shortsightedness, and thirst for power, the Segbandal started as an alliance of equals. Is this alliance still feasible, or should we leave it in the past?"

 gor_vazumbrog_hands_of_stone_title:0 "Hands of Stone"
 gor_vazumbrog_hands_of_stone_desc:0 "The advancements in golemancy bring about new opportunities for clearing the Wound. Golems are immune to the mind-altering spells, and while losing them to the destructive lingering spells is costly, it is still a better outcome than risking dwarven lives. The main challenge lies in programming them beforehand, as their orders cannot be altered once they enter the pit. However, their ability to move and handle broken and malfunctioning artefacts - the root cause of the toxic magic that plagues the Wound - has proven essential in opening up new areas in what used to be upper Vaults."

 gor_vazumbrog_perfecting_our_defences_desc:0 "The sudden attack caught us unprepared, our defenses crumbling like brittle stone. In response, the Arm of Krummul is moving swiftly, reinforcing fortifications and expanding scouting facilities to prevent another disaster. Construction is already underway, a massive effort to secure our borders. Yet not all agree on the path forward, and the debate stirs in the halls. Sooner or later, we must decide how best to shield our citadels from the threats ahead."

 gor_vazumbrog_history_lessons_title:0 "History Lessons"
 gor_vazumbrog_history_lessons_desc:0 "Dragons belong to legend, their presence nothing more than old tales - until now. None have been seen in ages, the last recorded sighting in Khugdihr, where a red dragon fell to a band of adventurers four centuries ago. If we are to stand a chance, we must learn from the past. We’ll send scouts directly to Khugdihr, seek the wisdom of our kin in Silverforge, and consult Anbenncost’s Order of Chroniclers. Only history can teach us how to slay a myth."

 gor_vazumbrog_how_to_hurt_a_dragon_title:0 "How to Hurt a Dragon"
 gor_vazumbrog_how_to_hurt_a_dragon_desc:0 "The dragon’s attack shook us to the core. Our weapons, our magic, even our strongest defenses - none of it mattered. That must change. We’ll forge the biggest cannons our forges can handle, seek out the artillery masters of Ovdal Kanzad, and test our firepower until our generals wield it as naturally as a blade. Next time, we won’t just stand and watch as our walls burn. Next time, we’ll answer fire with fire."

 gor_vazumbrog_no_stone_unturned_title:0 "No Stone Unturned"
 gor_vazumbrog_no_stone_unturned_desc:0 "The dragon struck, slaying the General-King and leaving our hold in ruin - then, just as suddenly, she was gone. How can something so massive simply vanish? One thing is certain, she remains somewhere in Middle Dwarovar; The region’s isolation, sealed off by the Oza and Vazok tunnels, ensures that. Our scouts will not rest until they scour every tunnel, every cavern, every shadowed crevice."

 gor_vazumbrog_charity_title:0 "Charity"
 gor_vazumbrog_charity_desc:0 "Among the wreckage, an old mason searches desperately, his trembling hands pulling at the stones of his collapsed forge. His son had been inside when the dragon came.\n\nA brewer returns to his ruined tavern, the great barrels split open, golden ale soaking into the dust. He kneels and scoops a handful, as if he could save it.\n\nA miner stares at the collapsed tunnel where his crew once stood. The air is still. He presses his ear to the stone, hoping, praying, for a knock in return.\n\nWe cannot undo what has been lost, but we can stand together. The wounded will be cared for, the fallen honored, and from these ashes, we will rise again."

 gor_vazumbrog_golems_in_the_army_desc:0 "The old titanium golems were no match for the dragon, but the Vaultwardens are already ablaze with ideas to make them stronger. Yet, adapting a golem for battle is no simple feat - especially when the ancient scripts only account for melee combat, and teaching them to wield firearms is an entirely new challenge. Still, if we succeed, we will have a titanium army that never tires, never wavers, and - hopefully - never breaks."

 gor_vazumbrog_dauntless_drills_title:0 "Dauntless Drills"
 gor_vazumbrog_dauntless_drills_desc:0 "Our Monster Hunters and General Staff have found common ground at last. Adventurers are learning the value of discipline and drills, while the army has embraced the doctrine of adaptable, smaller battalions, granting them greater independence. To support this shift, junior officers are now trained to lead with flexibility, ensuring that regiments split during cavern warface can operate even without direct orders."

 gor_vazumbrog_black_gold_title:0 "Black Gold"
 gor_vazumbrog_black_gold_desc:0 "Our merchants speak of a black mineral, produced by the Red Ogres of Haless, said to drink in magic like a bottomless pit. If the rumours are true, it could be the key to countering the toxic sorcery that festers in the Wound. Our scholars have also unearthed an ancient relic with potent reversive properties. If we can fuse the two, we may finally have a way to cleanse the corruption."

 gor_vazumbrog_sister_hold_desc:0 "Though known as the Dwarovar’s Youngest, Gor Ozumbrog bears a history steeped in struggle and bloodshed. We share a unique bond with the Topaz Dwarves, our holds standing as twin sentinels in the west and east of Middle Dwarovar. Now, as we face new threats, we must secure the region once more. To ensure Ozumbrog does not fall again, we will construct a formidable bastion at the Oza Tunnel - a citadel akin to Bogig Vazumbrog."

 gor_vazumbrog_bonded_by_firepower_title:0 "Bonded by Firepower"
 gor_vazumbrog_bonded_by_firepower_desc:0 "In some nations, magic and technology are considered incompatible. But in our hold, a curious bond has formed between our runemages and the Order of Vaultwardens. Not over philosophy, but over firepower.\n\nIn workshops and testing grounds, they push boundaries together, blending rune-etched spellwork with mechanical precision. Enchanted grenades, self-reloading cannons, spell-forged ammunition - each innovation a challenge to outdo the last. What began as rivalry has become camaraderie, a shared obsession with who can make things explode bigger, louder, and deadlier. The result? Weapons beyond anything the Dwarovar has ever seen."

 gor_vazumbrog_into_the_vaults_title:0 "Into the Vaults"
 gor_vazumbrog_into_the_vaults_desc:0 "The Vault Delves began and still continue as a mission of necessity - a grim effort to purge the Wound of its corruption. Yet, among the General Staff, there are more than a few who have become captivated by what lies within. The relics unearthed are not just dangerous; they are horrifying, their very presence unsettling even the most hardened veterans. The losses suffered in these expeditions are staggering, entire squads vanishing into the depths, claimed by things beyond comprehension. And yet, despite the cost, the rewards are undeniable. Even our most limited forays have yielded knowledge, artifacts, and power beyond reckoning. What we have uncovered already reshapes our understanding of magic, war, and the world itself. And deeper still, in those ruins, even greater secrets await."

But now, their lands are under assault by gnolls and even darker forces. We will not stand idly by. Safeguarding Azka-Sur is not just an act of friendship but also a matter of our security. By securing Salahad with a forward citadel, we carve a dagger into the enemy’s supply lines, disrupting their movements before they reach our walls. This stronghold will shield our allies and buy Seghdihr the time it needs to prepare for any storm that may come."

 gor_vazumbrog_relay_network_title:0 "Relay Network"
 gor_vazumbrog_relay_network_desc:0 "Dwarovar rail network lies in ruins, a shadow of the marvel it was in the days of Aul-Dwarov, when it carried goods and information across the depths with unmatched speed. Our attempts at restoration have seen only limited success, and with our borders now stretched thin, a new solution is needed. We will establish a vast relay network - couriers stationed along every tunnel, communication centers at key junctions, ensuring that messages and supplies flow swiftly through the dark once more."

 gor_vazumbrog_fire_with_fire_title:0 "Fire with Fire"
 gor_vazumbrog_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "Our search for knowledge of dragons has borne fruit. Apparently, one of the kin of Hunter of the Deep revealed himself publicly in 1439, in the distant mountain range of Khetapera. While no dragon can ever be trusted, this 'Aakhet', seems at least willing to talk. He leads a human nation, surrounded by devoted followers, and is rumored to amass great weaponry. We will bring him a worthy offering, hoping to pry some insight from this dangerous encounter."

 gor_vazumbrog_atlas_maior_title:0 "Atlas Maior"
 gor_vazumbrog_atlas_maior_desc:0 "Our relentless search for any trace of the dragon has yielded nothing, yet our efforts were not fully in vain. One of our esteemed Vaultwardens, Fimbur Battlebeard, has unveiled 'Atlas Maior', a masterwork of scholarship and cartography. This exhaustive tome details the vast cave networks, their labyrinthine connections, and the hidden veins of Middle Dwarovar. Rich sections on the region’s unique flora and fauna provide unparalleled insight, while its geological speculations push the boundaries of dwarven understanding. Though we have not yet found our quarry, we have mapped the bones of our world more thoroughly than ever before."

 gor_vazumbrog_forging_the_armour_title:0 "Forging the Armour"
 gor_vazumbrog_forging_the_armour_desc:0 "A wall is only as strong as its weakest stone, but when that stone is the very cornerstone, its failure spells ruin. When the dragon struck, the death of our General-King shattered the chain of command, throwing our forces into disarray. Such a catastrophe cannot happen again. Our master smiths will forge a suit of armor like no other, crafted from the rarest materials found in the depths of the Serpentspine, and adorned with strongest runes. When the next storm comes, our foundation will not falter."

 gor_vazumbrog_protective_runes_title:0 "Protective Runes"
 gor_vazumbrog_protective_runes_desc:0 "The saying that titanium is unbreakable is a comforting lie. Given enough force, anything will shatter. But what we teach our young is not the illusion of invincibility - it is the power of perseverance. When beaten down, we do not surrender; we adapt, we harden, we rise stronger than before. We've seen what the Hunter's breath did to our soldiers - we will weave face helmets to defy her toxic clouds. Our Titanium Golems have been melted into slag - we have now devised new runes to shield them from ruin. Every lesson we learn is another step toward victory. She will find us unyielding, reforged, and ready."

 gor_vazumbrog_new_vaults_title:0 "New Vaults"
 gor_vazumbrog_new_vaults_desc:0 "Before the Fall, our Vaults safeguarded the hazardous and the forbidden: devices of terrible power, artifacts steeped in peril, volatile ideas, and - sometimes - dwarves deemed too dangerous to roam free. We thought mere containment was enough, but the destruction of the Vaults proved us gravely mistaken. Their contents still haunt us. This time, our rebuilt Vaults will not be mere storage tombs. They will be places of study and scrutiny, where every danger is understood, dismantled, and its lessons shared, ensuring we are never blind to the dangers again."

 gor_vazumbrog_picking_up_the_sword_desc:0 "The sword, for all its legendary renown, is... underwhelming. The grip, wrapped in ancient, brittle leather, bites uncomfortably into the hand. Its balance is off, weighted too far toward the blade, as if it were forged for a giant rather than a dwarf. Perhaps Krummul's strength wasn't just a thing of legends. The General-King had expected resistance when he proposed taking it from the tomb - at least a murmur of protest from the general staff, some whispered concern of sacrilege - but no such voices rose. The sword may be flawed, but its weight was more than metal. It was a symbol.\n\nLet's hope it can still cleave skies."
