 yudunyovi.1.t: "Winds of Ancestry"
 yudunyovi.1.desc: "With the recent resettlement of Triunic peoples into their ancestral steppe homelands, there’s been a movement to rediscover the old ways. Locally supported archeological digs are sprouting up around the new settlements and many artifacts have been discovered. Most of these are the usual suspects; axe heads, pottershards and old refuse pits that give insight into how the ancient Zabatlari lived. But there have also been religious artifacts, giving insight into how they worshipped. Amongst all this discovery, however, a strange phenomenon has emerged; settlers have begun hearing a strange voice in their dreams. The cause is unknown and the reports are unusually consistent, needless to say many academics have found it very interesting."
 yudunyovi.1.a: "Interesting Indeed"

 yudunyovi.2.t: "A Shine Long Lost"
 yudunyovi.2.desc: "The focus of the Triunic settlers has become focused on the religion of the old inhabitants of the steppes. They tell tales of the old world and the old ways gathered from the Ustiq’lik, grand monoliths of unknown origin whose bodies are inscribed with the tales of the ancient Zabatlari. The tales are whispered to them by the voice in their dreams; the name Soiti has been rediscovered upon the Ustiq’lik and given to this speaker. They tell the tale of a land of fire and wind, shining with a splendor unrivalled in all of the world. They tell the tale of…"
 yudunyovi.2.a: "…The Wordly Gods."

 yudunyovi.3.t: "The Enlightenment of the Steppes"

 yudunyovi.4.t: "[Root.YudunyoviSpawnTitle]"
 yudunyovi.4.descSpawn: "The worldly gods have spread amongst the people of the plains like a fire through dry grass. It is not just some cultural revival movement, either – the centaurs too are converting in droves. These people see this new faith as a return to a time of glory and splendor, a time of glorious shining light. Among these gods are familiar faces, though in unrecognizable forms; Enuuk and Kodave absent, yet Yukel remains. Even Irdaeos is worshipped now, under the name Shirdos. Before all these gods were worshipped as individuals, but now the people of the steppe worship them all together as a unified whole; the Yudunyovi pantheon has been reborn."
 yudunyovi.4.descElse: "The Yudunyovi pantheon has been reborn and many of our subjects have chosen to convert to its worship. It has caused many to ask if the nation as a whole should convert. For so long we have chosen to worship but one of these gods and it has brought much strife with the followers of the others. We could worship all of them together; we could embrace that shining future…"
 yudunyovi.4.a: "And I too now see the light."
 yudunyovi.4.b: "Blasphemy!"

 yudunyovi.10.t: "Gods of the People"
 yudunyovi.10.desc: "We are prepared to discover more about the worldly gods and their worship. Still, it is best to focus our efforts in one area so as to not overextend ourselves. The only question is: what area that should be?"

 yudunyovi.20.t: "Taqoshurs Blessing"
 yudunyovi.20.desc: "Across the land our people have felt the sun’s light. Not a harsh hot light, but a soothing warmth. Old wounds of the heart seem to heal in its glow, livestock seem calmer and the people kinder. Surely this is a blessing from Taqoshur!"
 yudunyovi.20.a: "Glory be to his name"

 yudunyovi.21.t: "Visited by Soiti"
 yudunyovi.21.desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] awakens with a jolt. In their sleep [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] heard a voice, one that was clear and clearly wasn’t part of them. The voice told [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] of magic, of how it flowed and shifted. The voice told of how one can make magic move the way one wishes it too. After awakening, the dream did not fade as most dreams do and the techniques the voice spoke of have proved to be very effective. It’s clear that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been visited by Soiti!"
 yudunyovi.21.a: "“Thank you Grandparent”"

 yudunyovi.22.t: "Worldly Reclamation"
 yudunyovi.22.desc: "At last, at last our quest has reached its end. The land of our ancestors, Surakes - known to others as Bulwar - is under our dominion. The people here have long been lost and scared, when the worldly gods faded from view they turned fully to Taqoshur, whom they call Surael, to protect them from darkness. They did not forget the gods, but thinking them dead led to a worse state. The greatest gift we gave these people was not the strength of our government or the restored unity of the land, but the good news that the worldly gods live and Taqoshur is not alone. Even lost and confused, they have cared for Taqoshur’s garden, and we stand in awe of the flowers blooming - many were even sown by people unrelated to our ancestors but those blooms hold beauty as well. Now all the homeland has been reclaimed. All the gods have been remembered. We are united, but not in the anaemic unity of the Kalyin worshippers, where all are mere parts of one whole. Like the worldly gods themselves, though Triunic, centaur, dwarven or Bulwari are all distinct, through the divine we are one."
 yudunyovi.22.a: "And Taqoshur’s sun shines on us all"

 yudunyovi.100.t: "Gods of the People"
 yudunyovi.100.desc: "Our years of loyalty to our chosen benefactor have been long and arduous, but we must decide if they were fruitful enough. Advisors scramble in the court, arguing for their choice of allegiance to suit their own goals, but the final choice lies with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nWill we continue our support for our original choice or risk their anger by betraying them and choosing another to show our loyalty to."

 #Government Reforms
 centaur_worldly_enlightenment_reform: "Worldly Enlightenment"
 centaur_worldly_enlightenment_reform_desc: "After we were forced out of our homeland and our very god was slain by humans, we were adopted by Irdaeos. Many of our kind sought to slay the humans in vengeance, but the loss of our lands to the humans is clear evidence of divine disfavor and now its source is known. Irdaeos is truly Shirdos and works in a pantheon of gods, including the gods of the humans. Now we know what we must do; as we migrate across the plains, we shall spread the true worship of Shirdos to our wayward kin."

 yudunyovi_followers_of_many_gods_reform: "Followers of Many Gods"
 yudunyovi_followers_of_many_gods_reform_desc: "The Yudunyovi pantheon consists of many gods, all with their own unique strengths. Just because Taqoshur is the leader of the pantheon does not mean that worshipping gods lesser in the hierarchy is not worthwhile. To dedicate all our worship to just one god is to invite deficiencies in the areas that lie outside their purview. Shirdos cannot make the sun shine anymore than Taqoshur can conjure storms. Every god has their role and when faced with a certain challenge we ought to appeal to the most suitable god."

 yudunyovi_dedicated_followers_reform: "Dedicated Followers"
 yudunyovi_dedicated_followers_reform_desc: "Though all the worldly gods are worthy of worship, our ruler has chosen to devote their passion and interest to one god. This is the way it has been for many years in the Forbidden Plains, with the Triunics focusing their worship on one of the lake goddesses and the centaurs worshipping Shirdos, known to them as Idreaos. Many fellow worshippers feel solidarity with our leader; we would never try to assert our god as supreme over the others, but for us there is one we love most."

 #Estate Privlieges
 estate_mages_dream_speakers: "Dream Speakers"
 estate_mages_dream_speakers_desc: "It is known that the N’potsoit, or mages as they are known in most of the world, are descendants of the god of dreams Soiti. As such they seek to commune with Soiti, who will occasionally visit their dreams and grant them insight. However, Soiti doesn’t only visit their grandchildren's dreams; by engaging in this commune ourselves we shall surely gain the respect of the N’potsoit."

 estate_orachov_ustiqlik_beneration: "Ustiq’lik Beneration"
 estate_orachov_ustiqlik_beneration_desc: "The Ustiq’lik are signs of Taqoshur’s divine power here on Halann, so large that they serve as natural landmarks. They are inscribed with the ancient stories of the worldly gods; were they not, it would have taken even Soiti much longer to reveal the truth to us. They radiate heat which let the ancients survive the harsh winter. Recently the heat has begun to fade. This is a sign from Taqoshur that we are ready to survive on our own, that we no longer need to be coddled like children. We see the effects of age on these divine structures. Erosion is the intended fate of these grand monoliths and we should appreciate them while we can."
 estate_orachov_ustiqlik_beneration_tt: "Developing a §YYudunyovi§! province in the §YForbidden Lands§! (excluding Yyl Möitsa) with §Y0§!

They are inscribed with the ancient stories of the worldly gods; were they not it would have taken even Soiti much longer to reveal the truth to us. They radiate heat which let the ancients survive the harsh winter. Recently the heat has begun to fade. This is a most worrying sign - these are sacred to Taqoshur, implements of his divine will. That they have fallen into ruin is shameful, a consequence of our forgetting the gods. We must reverse this ruination… we command a nation and with a nation's work the divine obelisks can yet be saved."
 estate_church_ustiqlik_caretaking_tt: "§YYudunyovi§! provinces in the §YForbidden Lands§! (excluding Yyl Möitsa) with §Y20§! Development and a §YTemple§! gain '§YPowerful Ustiq’lik§!' giving §G-10.0%§! Local Construction Cost and §G+10.0%§! Local Goods Produced Modifier until the end of the game"
