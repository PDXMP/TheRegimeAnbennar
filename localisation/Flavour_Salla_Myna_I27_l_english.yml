 flavour_salla_myna.1.d: "Bricena going to visit her father, have her come across him and a small band of elder elves hunting goblins in Corsmyraeth 'because they were bored'.

 flavour_salla_myna.3.t: "Retaking the Reins"
 flavour_salla_myna.3.d: "Bricena returning as full-time ruler... to much relief among her subjects. Though Gylandor might be a legendary general, he is a far less talented administrator and diplomat, and has managed to insult foreign dignitaries and alienate members of the Minor Salla."

 flavour_salla_myna.6.d: "Feast in Elynaile to celebrate the reconquest of the Lake Grove. However, Farwen Elyn chokes on an olive of all things, and Cinrthir - if he's alive - has little desire left to rule, with his oldest daughter dead and his grove retaken, and so retires, putting a council in place until the fate of the Salla can be decided. Uncertainty as to what happens next, since Arfil is nominally next in line, but a personal union is a rare thing."
 flavour_salla_myna.6.a: "Oh no."

 flavour_salla_myna.10.d: "Bricena and Arfil journeying to the Silent Lake... to spend time with their fathers. At the end of a family dinner, Cinrthir asks whether they will ask him to suport Arfil as the heir, and in effect put his Salla under the control of Salla Myna.\n\nBricena and Arfil responds that they are plenty busy as is, and want to let Cinrthir grieve in peace rather than pressuring him.\n\nAt which point Cinrthir smiles and gives them a letter, asking them to take it to the regency council. Of course, the lesser proclaims Arfil the leader of Salla Elyn."
 flavour_salla_myna.10.a: "To guide these lives we see"

 flavour_salla_myna.11.t: "The First Steps"
 flavour_salla_myna.11.d: "Bricena speaking to the Great Hawks through a Druid serving as translator. Or rather, trying to do so, because the Great Hawks fly off whenever they approach. Druid offers to charm them, but when asked, admits that it will not help long-term cooperation. He can ensure that they are willing to tolerate his presence, but that spell does not extend to Bricena.\n\nWhen asked for his advice, he says that other than taking eggs from a nest and raising them in captivity - something his Circle would vehemently oppose - she would likely need to spend years around the hawks before they would be willing to tolerate her presence."
 flavour_salla_myna.11.a: "Years, you say? I'll have my desk moved here. Yes, really."

 flavour_salla_myna.12.t: "The Fealgarn Negotiations"
 flavour_salla_myna.12.d: "After having exchanged many letters and even met with Oberon in person, the negotiations seemed... well, they hadn't said no, but Oberon was making outrageous demands. He had initially demanded that Myna aid him in retaking his entire Grove before he would even hear her out, but Bricena managed to get him to agree... but then after months, demanded that Bricena acknowledge him as Ceannassai to share even the basics of the ritual.\n\nCould be told through Bricena venting to Arfil."
 flavour_salla_myna.12.a: "Time for an alternative approach."

 flavour_salla_myna.13.t: "Mountaintop Troubles"
 flavour_salla_myna.13.d: "Bricena stubbornly sticking to doing paperwork atop the mountaintop, despite the fact that her usually calm demeanour is being somewhat tested by her circumstances and the frequent squawking of the hawks, leading to her being a bit more curt in her letters than she would usually be, which has led to some of the letters she exchanges with her fellow leaders to be more chilly than they would usually be."
 flavour_salla_myna.13.a: "It will be worth it."

 flavour_salla_myna.14.t: "Irate Advisors"
 flavour_salla_myna.14.d: "Advisors pleading with Bricena to start doing her paperwork back in her mansion where it's nice and warm and comfortable, rather than forcing them to travel to where she has taken her desk.\n\nAfter failing to persuade the advisors that her circumstances aren't so bad - and look, isn't that great hawk hatchling cute? - she realizes that she'll have to offer them some additional incentives to stay on as advisors until the hawks have gotten used to her."
 flavour_salla_myna.14.a: "Fine, give them some bonuses."

 flavour_salla_myna.15.t: "Habituation"
 flavour_salla_myna.15.d: "Bricena and Arfil having a picnic together atop the Ciranmyna peak, with great hawks being far more willing to tolerate their presence than a year ago. Use conversation to show that the populace of Ciranmyna are starting to lose their reservation about the great hawks.\n\nAlso have a fledgling/juvenile great hawk sneak up on Bricena and Arfil and steal some of their food before flying off, to much laughter from the pair."
 flavour_salla_myna.15.a: "Good to hear."

 flavour_salla_myna.16.t: "Steady Progress"
 flavour_salla_myna.16.d: "Since her picnic with Arfil a year ago, Bricena has taken to taking 'naps' while at her table... while making sure to leave plenty of food out on the table. It has ensured that the newest generation of great hawks have started getting comfortable taking food from her desk so long as she's still."
 flavour_salla_myna.16.a: "Wonderful."

 flavour_salla_myna.17.t: "New Thoughts"
 flavour_salla_myna.17.d: "Bricena visiting her father to tell him about some of the ideas coming from outside the Deepwoods. He is quite set in his ways and so dismissive of most of them, but maintains that it's not for him to decide whether or not to implement any of them. That choice lies solely with Bricena."
 flavour_salla_myna.17.a: "A new age is dawning."

 flavour_salla_myna.18.t: "Negitiations Reconsidered"
 flavour_salla_myna.18.d: "Bricena had only just managed to suppress her smile as Oberon entered the hall. The normally gruff and stern Ceann of Salla Fealgarn was as close to a whipped puppy as Bricena had ever seen him. She gestured for her attendants to leave her, and offered him a seat.\n\n“So, you need my help,” Bricena said after a short exchange of pleasantries. Oberon sighed. “I do. I appear to have… overstepped somewhat with Irvah and Alara. I cannot afford to lose their support, not now.” Bricena clicked her tongue. “You certainly have a talent for that. First you rile up the eastern Salla at Elynaíle, and now the south. Are you intent on turning the whole Deepwoods against you?” Oberon gave her a foul look “Oh, I am aware, thank you. Look, let us keep this simple. You can help me, and I have something you want.”\n\nBricena had to suppress a smile again. She had him. “And that thing is?” Oberon was quiet for a moment. Bricena shook her head. “No, none of this. I need to hear you say it.”\n\nClearly pained, Oberon brought his hand to his heart, then stretched out his palm. “The ritual of bonding. If you help me, you will have it. With no further demands.”\n\nSmiling gracefully, Bricena copied his gesture, and took his hand."
 flavour_salla_myna.18.a: "Then we have a deal."

 flavour_salla_myna.19.t: "The Ritual"
 flavour_salla_myna.19.d: "Bricena negotiating with the great hawks. Ends with the druids performing a ritual to create a bond between her and the hawk that squawked at her, soon binding them as companions, allowing them to share vague concepts. It's not quite speech, but according to the Fealgarn notes, it might one day border on being able to read each others' minds."
 flavour_salla_myna.19.a: "Take flight!"

 # If possible, please look to the HTTYD flight scene for inspitation here.
 flavour_salla_myna.20.t: "The First Flight"
 flavour_salla_myna.20.d: "Bricena could feel the great hawk’s muscles coil through its feathers as she climbed on its back. For a moment, she could feel the hawk’s thoughts, feeling it readjust its stance to account for her weight. Then, with a powerful thrust of its wings, they lifted off, soaring high above the emerald sprawl of the Deepwoods. Then immediately, the hawk dived.\n\nPanicked, Bricena dug her fingers into the hawk’s feathers.\n\nThey approached the canopy at breakneck speed, only for the hawk to adjust its direction again right before colliding with the upper branches.\n\nBricena felt the wind whip through her hair and scream in her ears as the treetops turned into a blur beneath them. It was terrifying. It was liberating.\n\nAs the flight continued and her nerves and excitement died down, however, Bricena regained control of her thoughts. In the clearings below her, she saw figures looking up at her, as ants to her. She would be well out of arrowshot of them, but if she had her bow with her they would be at her utter mercy. With this speed, this height—Salla Myna could be unstoppable. She tugged on the hawk’s shoulder, and wheeled back toward Ciranmyna. In the distance, she saw dozens of great hawks take flight from the slopes of Ciranmyna. Every single one carrying a figure on its back."
 flavour_salla_myna.20.a: "The sky is ours."

 flavour_salla_myna.21.t: "Visits Far"
 flavour_salla_myna.21.d: "Arfil telling Bricena that they need to be in Salla Cenág urgently, then the two of them hopping on hawk riders and riding off, with some guards following them, of course.\n\nWhen they get there, there's no emergency... but the Ceanna Cenag plays dumb for a minute, asking how they could know that he had asked them to meet him. Surely, his letter could not have arrived more than a few days ago, but they are already here!\n\nIn other words, setting some hawks aside for diplomats would be a major diplomatic boon."
 flavour_salla_myna.21.a: "There is potential in this."

 flavour_salla_myna.22.t: "The Hunter and the Archer"
 flavour_salla_myna.22.d: "During victory celebrations in Fealgarn capital, Oberon offers a few tips as to how the Hawk Riders could be better deployed against the Goblins and Orcs. Somehow, news of this reaches Ayethstir, as Elaria shows up not long after, glaring daggers at Oberon and having every intention of showing him up.\n\nThe impromptu competition between them results in the development of the so-called "Arrowstorm Doctrine" by combining the ideas of the two military masterminds."
 flavour_salla_myna.22.a: "Intriguing!"

 flavour_salla_myna.23.t: "Ceannasai"
 flavour_salla_myna.23.d: "Bricena having summoned the other Ceanna to Ciranmyna, and while Arfil was entertaining them, Bricena herself arrives fashionably late... on her great hawk, of course.\n\nSome of the Ceanna are visibly impressed with her status as hawk rider... and others are just better at hiding it, but not good enough to hide it from Bricena.\n\nShe starts speaking, admitting that she will never be a great general like her father... but then say that they do not need that. They needed someone who could bind them together, help overcome differences, and lead them into a bright new future, rather than leading them into war from the front."
 flavour_salla_myna.23.a: "I am Ceannassai of the Deepwoods."

 flavour_salla_myna.24.t: "The Unification"
 flavour_salla_myna.24.d: "Negotiating the finer terms of the Deepwoods unification took time, of course. Different Ceanna had conditions they wished to be met for their grove, asked for specific court position, and so on, and even after that had been settled, there were ceremonies and - of course - a parade, to mark that the Wood Elves were united once more.\n\nBricena had not slept so little since the siege at the start of her reign, but after a month her new position was finally firmly established, and she could take the time to visit her father."
 flavour_salla_myna.24.a: "A quiet evening sounds very good right now."

 flavour_salla_myna.25.t: "A Father's Pride"
 flavour_salla_myna.25.d: "Bricena being dropped off on her father's lake boat by her hawk, eager to see him after having united the Deepwoods.\n\nAnd she sees him. Sitting still in his favorite chair, a serene smile on his face... but his eyes are closed and he does not draw breath. Lying in front of him is an open leather-bound journal. Bricena begins crying immediately, of course, and only more so when she gathers herself enough to read the page.\n\nMourn me not, my darling daughter. Always have I known that you would lead our Salla to greatness. However, when I retired, I did not even have the fantasy to imagine that you might do what you did.\n\nYou, Bricena, have proven yourself a far greater leader than I ever was or could have been, and I die a happy man, knowing that you have done what I once thought impossible: uniting our fragmented people. \n\nStand tall, my daughter, and know that no man could be prouder of his child than I am of you, and that seeing you far exceed the hopes I have had for you has allowed me to die a happy man.\n\n- Your loving father"
 flavour_salla_myna.25.a: "I'm not crying, you are."
