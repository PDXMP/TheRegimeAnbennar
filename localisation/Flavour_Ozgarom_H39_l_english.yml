 flavour_ozgarom.101.t: "Massive Uprising in Endralliande!"
 flavour_ozgarom.101.d: "Disaster! Our colony in Endralliande has been struck by a massive revolt; the local orcs are in open rebellion. Following an apparently spontaneous uprising on three nearby estates along Endral’s Coast, a huge and vexingly well-organised force of freed orc labourers has begun looting our settlements for food and supplies, overwhelming our local garrisons and butchering innocents.\n\nThese savages are led by a figure known only as Bramash, some hedge mage - the sort the orcs call a ‘shaman’ - who has set his talent as an Abjurer to the purpose of murdering innocent civilians. His forces threaten the entire region, and are growing with every estate he puts to the torch. A preposterous set of dispatches from this Bramash’s so-called ‘Cabinet of Freedom’ have already slipped out of our ports in the region, and our enemies will waste no time in slandering us based on such lies."
 flavour_ozgarom.102.d: "While the occasional revolt of enslaved orcs is hardly a novelty for the plantations of Endralliande, the uprising which has erupted over the last few weeks is of unprecedented scale. Following an apparently spontaneous revolt on three nearby estates along Endral’s Coast, a huge and surprisingly well-organised force of orcs has begun looting major settlements for food and supplies, overwhelming local colonial garrisons more suited for policing than a pitched campaign.\n\nThe rebel slaves are led by a figure known only as Bramash, an autodidact shaman with a prodigious grasp of Abjuration. His forces are sweeping across the region, freeing as they go, and missives dispatched from a so-called ‘Cabinet of Freedom’ have already made their way to sympathetic Corinite circles. Their stated goal is nothing less than freedom for every enslaved orc in Aelantir."
 flavour_ozgarom.101.a: "Crush these rebels!"
 flavour_ozgarom.102.a: "We will watch the situation carefully."
 flavour_ozgarom.102.b: "Our abolitionist radicals urge us to support the fight against slavery."
 flavour_ozgarom.102.c: "A chance to undercut our colonial rivals."

 flavour_ozgarom.103.t: "Estates Overtaken!"
 flavour_ozgarom.103.d: "Bramash’s brutal rebellion has claimed another cluster of estates, their rightful owners either thrown out with nothing or butchered in their beds. Yet more troops for Bramash to wield against the rightful rulers of Endralliande!"
 flavour_ozgarom.103.a: "Curses!"

 flavour_ozgarom.104.t: "[Root.flavour_ozgarom_104_t]"
 flavour_ozgarom.104.t1: "Orc Rebels Flee Endralliande!"
 flavour_ozgarom.104.t2: "Orc Rebels Pivot to Soruin!"
 flavour_ozgarom.104.d1: "When the upstart Bramash first swept across Endralliande in his campaign of butchery, we feared the worst. His troops even threatened $CAPITAL_CITY$ and the stability of our colony altogether! Yet in recent weeks our brave forces have prevailed, smashing Bramash’s host and liberating estate after estate as we reassert order across the island.\n\nDesperate and aware of just how little rope he had remaining, Bramash has laid waste to naval supply depot and seized a small merchant fleet, quitting the island altogether. While we might have preferred the capture of Bramash and a proper execution, his flight in such a manner does his propaganda efforts no credit whatsoever, and in the wake of his departure, our labourers will be easily cowed."
 flavour_ozgarom.104.d2: "We have watched with utter dismay as the rebel Bramash has swept across Endralliande, torching our estates and placing our entire colonial effort into peril. Like any such rebel, he has done little but sow chaos, his joke of a ‘Cabinet of Freedom’ content simply to strip the gilt off the wardrobe rather than spare any thought to using it themselves. It is an embarrassment that we have been unable to defeat him squarely in the field, but it appears his destructive instincts have spared us in the end.\n\nUnwilling to face up to the challenge of actually ruling a country, Bramash has proven himself the petty looter we knew him to be. His forces have quit Endralliande on a fleet laden with stolen goods, making for the mainland of Soruin. He hopes to hide himself in the deepest jungles of the continent, where our colonial fleets cannot find him.\n\nIn the meantime, we are left with a devastated island to rebuild. Such an abject failure to protect our colony has spurred endless recriminations at home; this must never happen again."
 flavour_ozgarom.104.a1: "Order prevails!"
 flavour_ozgarom.104.a2: "An ignoble episode."

 flavour_ozgarom.106.b2: "Perhaps Bramash can be cultivated for our ends."

 flavour_ozgarom.106.c2: "Our abolitionists continue to urge support of Bramash’s cause."
 flavour_ozgarom.106.e: "They had better choose somewhere else."

 flavour_ozgarom.108.t: "An Orcish Utopia In The Effelai?"
 flavour_ozgarom.108.d1: "Since the rebel orc Bramash fled from Endralliande, little has been heard from his ‘Cabinet of Freedom’. During the rebellion, his Cabinet corresponded with sympathetic abolitionists across two continents, smuggling missives past naval blockades to offer the world their story, their version of events. Only now has the Cabinet begun once more to issue proclamations, attempting once more to build ties with the outside world.\n\nThey describe a free orcish society, settlements struggling against the many threats of the Effelai, but united. Torn from clan and bloodline and moved at the will of their erstwhile masters, the free orcs of Soruin have little choice but to make a new clan – a clan of the people as a whole. Family reunification is often almost completely impossible, and so all must serve as family to everyone else. Even the native Soruinics of the jungle have been embraced as kin, a closeness which has already spurred intermarriage here and there.\n\nThe life is tough; the jungle itself holds many dangers. Yet the maroons of Soruin are free.\n\nThe Cabinet professes a desire for universal peace, but Bramash’s maroons are a constant provocation to the slaveowners of Soruin. Time will tell if such a way of life can truly survive under such pressure."
 flavour_ozgarom.108.d2: "When Bramash ‘Chainbreaker’ first rose in revolt on the island of Endralliande, we had little sympathy for our incompetent colonial rivals. Our orcs were kept well in hand, and we had little fear of the kind of insurrection which occurs when one neglects simple matters of security and authority. Now, however, their sickness has become ours.\n\nThe so-called ‘Cabinet of Freedom’ which Bramash maintained during his first revolt has been revived now that he has fled to Soruin - to our colonial lands. Now we are dealing with the consequences of Endralliander incompetence. His maroon settlements foment constant unrest among our labouring orc population and the native Soruinics alike - we are told the maroons and the natives have even begun to intermarry.\n\nAll the while, missives from his Cabinet invite interference from abroad. Their propaganda begins to speak of a thing called “Ozgarom” - the realm of the orcish free..."
 flavour_ozgarom.108.d3: "That damnable Bramash will not cease to vex us! Unsatisfied by laying waste to our holdings in Endralliande, he now seeks to undermine our legitimate rule in Soruin. We had hoped at first that he would disappear into the jungle and get himself eaten by something, but his maroon settlements have established themselves in the jungle highlands of Soruin and begun issuing the same sort of propagandist nonsense as they did during his last campaign. They begin to speak of “Ozgarom” - the realm of the orcish free...\n\nThe result? Our Soruinic labourers begin to rumble in discontent, passing the Cabinet of Freedom’s missives among themselves as they glower at their betters. Orcs from across Aelantir have begun to travel to Soruinic ports, dreaming of the free orcish society in the jungle. The natives and the maroons even begin to conspire, naming one another kin. We will not be caught off guard again; something is brewing here. If we do not prepare now, we will suffer the same calamity we did in Endralliande!"
 flavour_ozgarom.108.a: "Time will tell."
 flavour_ozgarom.108.b: "We will help it survive."
 flavour_ozgarom.108.c: "We must prepare for the worst."
 flavour_ozgarom.108.d: "That orc must die!"

 flavour_ozgarom.110.t: "The Declaration of Ozgarom"
 flavour_ozgarom.110.d1: "“Ye who suffer under the slaver’s yoke; ye who in the shadow of the workshop must tend the welts upon your back; ye who know what it is to suffer… there is an Ozgar orc at your side, even now. This is the pledge of the Ozgar people, we who have been dealt misery and who refuse to deal it in turn. We do not promise an end to suffering - we do not promise only peace. Only the knowledge, in the depths of despair, that we are searching for you.”\n\nThe maroons of Ozgarom kept the date secret. Many thousands of them, all aware, and not a single one a snitch. Perhaps there were those, paid by the colonial authorities to keep tabs on their settlement, who even in the depths of their cynicism could not betray their fellows. Perhaps for just a moment they felt that perfect hope: this might work! Perhaps this is why they said nothing; perhaps this is why Ozgarom caught everyone by surprise.\n\nOvernight, a country. Already the Ozgar Orcs have declared the end of slavery and an end to the expropriation of the native Soruinics. They demand that estate and plantation owners leave immediately, forfeit their property and submit to its division among their labouring orcs. They welcome surrender, but they fully expect to fight."
 flavour_ozgarom.110.d2: "We heard not a twitch from our informants among the maroons, the odd merchant or two that maintain the world of grey between our colonial towns and Bramash’s people in the sticks. No warning at all, until first one town, then another, fell to Bramash’s forces in the night. Indeed, the coordination of the thing speaks to a long-held plan - the occupation of entire provinces, the simultaneity of the strikes. Among the rebels are many native Soruinics, those courted by the maroons in their jungle settlements.\n\nOzgarom is rising.\n\nIn the times to come, this moment will be pored over. How we prepared, what we did, who we armed. There is something terrible about the certainty of these upstart savages, the absolute conviction which drives their cause. Yet ours is the cause of order, and we will not go without a fight."
 flavour_ozgarom.110.a: "Ozgarom is born."
 flavour_ozgarom.110.b: "What a noble cause!"
 flavour_ozgarom.110.c: "Suppress these fools."
 flavour_ozgarom.110.d: "They seem so sure..."
