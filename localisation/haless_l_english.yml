 haless.1.t: "Harimari Roam Further Afield"
 haless.1.desc: "As supplies are packed and homesteaders ready themselves for the journey ahead, our expedition leaders find several unexpected faces among the departing throng. Roaming Harimari have proved just as eager to explore new lands as their forefathers were, and seek permission to join the trek to new lands. The need to feed and supply these additional folk might add some strain to the project though.\nHow should our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] handle this new development?"
 haless.1.a: "Please come along! The more the merrier."
 haless.1.b: "Why you ought to be the experts. We’ll let you take the lead. "
 haless.1.c: "We cannot provide this much extra meat for the journey. The costs of feed or salt alone…"
 haless.1.d: "Why I know just what roles in the expedition would suit you."
 haless.1.e: "You may join the journey, but you’ll pay your own way. With administration fees."

 haless.2.t: "Roaming Spirits"
 haless.2.desc: "Reports come from a rural village in [roaming_spirits_province_target.GetName], these villages were impressively pious and had built up stable relationships with many spirits, leaving out libations and offerings to those that travel through and hosting festivals to honour those spirits they met. When they saw a group of tiger headed warriors draped in silk and golden jewellery they prostrated themselves before the strange spirit men, having never seen the Harimari before. While many Harimari hurried through, two of the young Harimari men enjoyed the hospitality of the faithful, drinking and eating through the village stores. When a travelling merchant explained the Harimari’s true nature, a local shaman grew furious and has since taken the harimari prisoner.\nOur priests and our community leaders are up in arms over this. What should we do?"
 haless.2.a: "These harimari boys are fools, but so are the men who believed them. Release them"
 haless.2.b: "If the travellers want their boys released, they will pay to replace what they took."
 haless.2.c: "Let the temples carry out their punishment. We do not mock the spirits."
 haless.2.d: "Send them to the spirits themselves, they will see justice dealt out."
 haless.2.e: "Tell my tax collectors “When someone asks if you’re a spirit, you say yes!”"

 haless.3.t: "Expert Travelers"
 haless.3.desc: "Harimari are famed throughout Haless as especially skilled Administrators, Courtiers and Generals, and many of the Harimari who choose to wander further from their homelands in Rahen and Yanshen bring those skills with them, making a living selling their trade to the rich and powerful who need a little extra help managing particular issues.\nNow a small caravan of these Roaming Harimari have emerged in the capital and offer help with your administration. The established courtiers are wary though, none suggesting that the extra hands wouldn’t help, but none volunteering to be the first to show their books to those outside the department."
 haless.3.a: "These scholars will ensure our censuses are up to date."
 haless.3.b: "These merchants will advise us on the flow of goods throughout the region."
 haless.3.c: "These sellswords will share their knowledge of tactical innovations."
 haless.3.d: "We trust our own above these outsiders. Send them on their way. "
 haless.3.e: "They ought to share all their knowledge, we can learn so much from each other."

 haless.4.t: "Harimari Sellsail"
 haless.4.desc: "While the harimari are feared throughout Haless as warriors and generals, for most the navies are still the domain of men. The larger harimari forms scarcely fit amid the tight confines and dangerous rigging of many sailing vessels. Some however, especially among the Roaming Harimari still take to the sea despite these difficulties, where they prove able to make good captains of themselves, with a particular skill in boarding actions. In the closer confines of a ship’s deck they can rip through smaller sailors before they have a chance to react.\nNow a Vandiphan captain has appeared on our shores, and offered his service as a naval commander."
 haless.4.a: "They will bring their fierceness to the high seas."
 haless.4.b: "The Navy is a poor fit for these folk, and promotion offers will keep our captains striving."

 haless.5.t: "Scholars Beyond the Temples"
 haless.5.desc: "It has long been considered a self evident truth that the high temples hold all the wisdom of the gods and that the proper place for many philosophers and monks is decoding the messages present in the reliefs, designs and geometries of those structures or else pondering and debating the nature of the heavens as explored through pure thought. However, many students and relatives of respected Roaming Harimari scholars have proposed the High Gods left proof of their divine purpose in other places, in the layout of hills and valleys, in the shapes formed by wind and weather. While some claim this as heresy, others within the community support this new philosophy and the leader of one such debate hall has come to ask for your blessing, hoping to bring their followers out of the high temples, and explore the world beyond."
 haless.5.a: "The temples must eternally be our priority."
 haless.5.b: "The High Gods’ influence is not bound to these complexes."
 haless.5.c: "We are familiar with the wisdom beyond the temples, send these scholars to other sites."

 haless.6.t: "New Accommodations Demanded"
 haless.6.desc: "The Roaming Harimari are newcomers to much of their current homeland, and unlike in Rahen or Yanshen they’ve never been an unchallenged ruling class. The codes of law we practise are derived from Nephrite codes or ancient human texts, without harimari having had the chance to carve out accommodations they now claim are necessary. Some of our structures are too small to comfortably accommodate them, and when they are in our care or service we have no obligation to provide them meat for their diet. They are in many easy to overlook ways foreign to us. Now a harimari scholar has come to our court with a list of amendments they claim are necessary to allow them to partake fully in our society."
 haless.6.a: "They deserve them, and their laws have built great empires in their homelands."
 haless.6.b: "We're under no obligation to treat them. The laws of our people have brought us this far."

 ### I would've put this in the events file, but the characters were screwed up

 haless.701.t: "Slumbering Voices Within the Mountain's Belly"
 haless.701.desc: "Excavating tunnels in the remote mountains of northern Yanshen is usually a mundane affair. Yet a recent discovery has stirred unease. In a disused shaft in [haless_mine_province.GetName], several miners have uncovered a stone stele carved with strange runes. Its form bears clear resemblance to the ritual iconography of the Devouring Path, and the surrounding chamber is littered with wax-sealed bones and shattered soul vessels.\n\nAfter careful examination, scholars have confirmed the site to be a remnant left behind by followers of the Devouring Path. Among the workers, the place is already being referred to as the \"Old Altar of the Devourer\", some even claiming that echoing voices rise from the shaft during the night.\n\nIt is time to decide how we shall respond to this buried trace of faith."
 haless.701.a: "Send mages to purify the tainted ruins"
 haless.701.b: "Seal off the shaft and mine elsewhere"
 haless.701.c: "Record the layout as a ritual method"
 haless.701.d: "This must be an Altar to the Mother Empire!"

 haless_lost_rite: "Completion of the Lost Rite"
 haless_devouring_rite: "Devouring Rite from the Mother Empire"

 haless.702.t: "The Iron of the Mountains"
 haless.702.desc: "The northern mountains of Yanshen have long been rich in iron, the backbone of the realm's arms and military strength. For generations, mining and governance here have been overseen by court-appointed officials working with local authorities. Most sites are managed directly by state offices under strict statutes to prevent mountain damage or unlawful extraction.\n\nRecently, highland officials report the emergence of a new method used by local miners and craftsmen: combining ancestral timber-frame tiering with folk-developed gunpowder blasting, which has greatly boosted ore yield without harming the terrain. This technique is only possible because of the unique stone of the Beikling and Demon Hills, yet the results are remarkable.\n\nLocals petition for the court to promote this method to other parts of the Beikling mining region. The court, though recognizing its merit, fears such expansion could invite misuse elsewhere, eroding mining regulations and disrupting coordination.\n\nShould one adapt to local advantage—or uphold the rules that bind the realm?"
 haless.702.a: "Recognize local innovation and promote reform"
 haless.702.b: "Do not proceed; maintain current mining standards"
 haless.702.c: "Send our mining specialists to assist the discussion"
 haless_mining_method: "Northern Ridge Mining Method"
 haless_central_supervision: "Central Supervision"
 haless_composite_extraction: "Composite Extraction"

 haless.703.t: "The Goldscale Accord"
 haless.703.desc: "The Goldscale Kobolds are renowned across Yan for their expertise in mountain trade routes. The golden scales they bear shimmer brilliantly under the sun, serving not only as a symbol of identity but also as a mark of credit and wealth. Their so-called “Goldscale Crafts” are crafted with ingenious mechanisms and rare mountain materials. Unique in design and craftsmanship, these goods are highly popular at markets and gatherings, beloved by both commoners and merchants alike.\n\nRecently, a prominent kobold trade guild from the region surrounding the Temple of Jinxiou has, for the first time, formally addressed the local authorities with a proposal to establish a mutual trade agreement. They suggest dispatching a delegation to reside permanently in the major towns of the Yanzhong region. The aim is to build a more stable supply network, expand their distribution channels, and promote closer commercial exchange. The guild promises to bring with them skilled Goldscale artisans, rare mountain goods, and finely crafted wares—injecting new vitality into the local economy.\n\nThis is the first time a kobold trade guild has proposed a partnership of this scale, drawing significant attention from local officials. Most view it favorably, believing it could broaden the market and boost tax revenue. However, some voices of concern have been raised: if a foreign merchant guild is allowed to take root locally, might they eventually control the arteries of commerce and marginalize native merchants in both livelihood and influence?"
 haless.703.a: "Grant them permanent presence; establish a Balance Mission at the border markets"
 haless.703.b: "Restrict their influence; enforce trade control"
 haless_goldscale_embassy: "Goldscale Embassy"

 haless.704.t: "Frontier Echoes"
 haless.704.desc: "Along the mountain frontier where Beikling meets Jiangyang, watch posts and forts have stood since ancient times, repaired yearly and manned by successive generations of soldiers. When wind sweeps the ridgeline, some claim to hear faint thunderous steps of giant birds from deep in the steppe—whether enemy riders or echoes of old wounds, none can say.\n\nThough no major conflict has broken out in recent years, alarms still come from the passes and rivers guarded here. A frontier commander now petitions to reinforce key outposts and rotate in more troops. Meanwhile, local officials propose a \"Frontier Labor Mandate\", calling on registered peasants to aid patrols in the off-season to offset shortages.\n\nThough concerning only part of the border, the plan has stirred debate in the capital: should we grant on-the-spot authority to strengthen defenses, or act cautiously to prevent militia practices from spreading?"
 haless.704.a: "Reinforce the forts and deploy more troops"
 haless.704.b: "Implement communal rotation duties"
 haless.704.c: "Maintain the current posture"
 haless.704.d: "Host caravans and organize frontier trade"
 haless_fortified_line: "Fortified Line"
 haless_militia_patrols: "Militia Patrols"
 haless_trade_hub: "Trade Hub"

 haless.705.t: "Tea Traditions of North and South"
 haless.705.desc: "Tea is more than a commodity—it is a part of life in Yanshen.\n\nAs tea-producing regions in both Naamjyut and Beikling continue to flourish, public debate grows over what constitutes the proper \"Way of Tea.\" In Beikling, emphasis is placed on water temperature, fire timing, and seasonal rhythms of the mountains—favoring restraint and discipline. In Naamjyut, by contrast, aroma and presentation reign supreme, blending forest aesthetics with artistic display.\n\nEvery few years, merchants and scholars from both regions hold informal tea competitions and exhibitions, sometimes even attracting the attention of high officials. Among the people, this has come to be known as the \"Northern-Southern Tea Duel.\"\n\nThis year, such an exchange unfolds under your rule. Local officials and trade guilds now request official recognition and guidance to represent their preferred regional styles. How will you respond?"
 haless.705.a: "Encourage mountain rituals to promote the Beikling culture"
 haless.705.b: "Endorse the Southern elegance in favor of the Jyut"
 haless.705.c: "Let both traditions flourish in open competition"

 haless_fusion_tradition: "Fusion of Tea Traditions"

 haless.706.t: "The Colors of the Jungle, the Shadows Beneath the Roof"
 haless.706.desc: "Dyes come from vines and mosses; motifs echo the markings of mist-worms and the veins of rainforest leaves. Homes nestle against the forest, rain from woven bamboo eaves falling clear of skirt and robe.\n\nAmong the Naamjyut, such patterns and aesthetics are deeply rooted in the daily lives of both commoners and artisans.\n\nThough generations in Yanshen have brought customs and values close to those of other Yanshen cultures, the Naamjyut crafts remain profoundly distinct, shaped by unique geography and history into a vivid artistic style. Dense forests, broad hills, and poor roads have kept their craft from spreading widely, yet preserved a rare local charm.\n\nFrom time to time, weaving officials or guild envoys visit, recording patterns for reproduction and trade. As with other regional crafts in Yanshen, Naamjyut textiles are gradually entering broader cultural exchange.\n\nYet as this jungle-born design language gains reach, \"Debate stirs: should this be codified as a traditional style with formal rules, or embraced as an unstandardized evolving style?\"\n\nFaced again with such a dispute, will you respond?"
 haless.706.a: "Establish standards and officially recognize the style."
 haless.706.b: "Let it be used freely without official sanction."
 haless.706.c: "This is not something we need to concern ourselves with."
 haless.706.d: "Vigorously promote our cultural identity."

 haless_exotic_naamjyut: "Exotic Naamjyut Attire"

 haless.707.t: "Ballads Beyond Understanding"
 haless.707.desc: "The dialects of Naamjyut are notoriously intricate—tones shift from mountain to mountain, and the melodies of children's songs differ even between neighboring forest villages.\n\nEvery so often, the issue of \"language unification\" resurfaces in local governance—some regional officials propose a standardized pronunciation system to improve administrative efficiency and coordination.\n\nYet the elders always resist.\n\nThey say: \"If my mother's lullaby is sung in a different tune, it's no longer the song of my home.\"\n\nMust language be made uniform? Or should songs remain shaped by the mountain winds?"
 haless.707.a: "Standardizing tongue is necessary. Civil officials must learn the capital dialect."
 haless.707.b: "Let village songs remain. We will slow the push for standardized speech."
 haless.707.c: "Adapt the written communication system to accommodate as many as possible."
 haless_language_promotion: "Language Promotion"

 haless_accommodation_local: "Accommodation of Local Speech"

 haless.708.t: "Voices Beneath the Canopy"
 haless.708.desc: "In vine-covered forests, old tongues still murmur. Among Naamjyut hillfolk, artisans, and spirit-guides, Kai words, songs, and storytelling are still used. Incense at festivals, totemic cloth, and burial rites all echo distant Kai traditions. Though long part of Yanshen culture, Kai-descended Naamjyut have not cut ties with the old realm beyond the mountains. Some clans keep kinship there; spirit-guides preserve ancient prayers; traders bring Kai incense and charm-scrolls through passes, known to elders. As Kai's politics shift and Yanshen unifies, some fear such links may sway Naamjyut's governance; others see them as heritage. Recently, one tribe's close dealings with the Kai have drawn wide debate. Will you respond?"
 haless.708.a: "Let the forest tongue be. It has its own path."
 haless.708.b: "Restrain these exchanges. The forests must remain orderly."
 haless.708.c: "Build the forest roads—let the mountain speak to the mountain."

 haless_suppressed_forest: "Suppressed Forest Speech"
 haless_road_old: "Road to the Old Realm"

 haless.709.t: "The Prosperous Yanhe"
 haless.709.desc: "Since ancient times, the banks of the Yan River have been the most prosperous lands in all of Yanshen. The broad and tranquil river teems with merchant vessels laden with rare goods, carrying wares from the borderlands and even distant Shamakhad to the celestial capital of Tianlou. This trade route was once maintained and modified by the empires of Harimar and Jaher to transport troops and grain. Even after their fall, the Yan River has continued to flow silently, nourishing the lands of Jiangszun.\n\nThe impact of this trade reaches far beyond merchants and the nobles who enjoy such luxuries—it has transformed many of the cities along the Yan. Their people, more than others in Yanshen, have grown fond of worldly pleasures. Dockworkers unload cargo through the day, then spend their generous pay reveling in the city's delights. These cities are filled with wine-houses, theaters, and exotic shops that remain open deep into the night. Their shimmering lights reflect upon the river, leading foreign visitors to marvel and name them \"cities that never sleep.\""
 haless.709.a: "Thriving commerce enriches the realm."
 haless.709.b: "Let the world know of this glory."
 haless.709.c: "Ensure this brilliance lasts forever."

 haless.710.t: "Descendants of the Waters"
 haless.710.desc: "For generations, the people of Jiangszun have lived along the Yanhe. This mighty river, running across the heart of Yanshen, nourishes not only fertile fields but also bustling towns and constant flows of merchants. \"Those who gain the water thrive; those who lose it fall into ruin.\"—so goes the saying of Jiangszun's ancestors.\n\nBut the bounty of the Yanhe has never been without risk. Flooding from heavy rains, siltation from drought, and the decay of neglected tributaries all threaten navigation and irrigation. Every generation must rise to the task of maintaining the river's breath and pulse.\n\nIn recent years, the section near [jiangszun_city_province.GetName] has again shown signs of trouble. Be it by flooding or blockage, boats struggle to pass and irrigation fails. Local officials and town representatives jointly petition for funding to repair levees, dredge channels, and restore locks. Some merchant guilds have offered to assist financially.\n\nHow shall we respond to this appeal concerning the lifeblood of the Yanhe?"
 haless.710.a: "Mobilize the laborers and clear the river."
 haless.710.b: "Enlist the guilds, share the returns."
 haless.710.c: "This is not a priority at present."
 haless.710.d: "Joint effort will bring mutual benefit."

 haless_river_joint: "Joint Yan River Effort"

 haless.711.t: "Broken Dike, Stagnant Waters"
 haless.711.desc1: "A long-neglected stretch of the Yanhe has gradually dried up near [jiangszun_city_province.GetName]. Once-bustling docks now stand exposed as sandbanks rise and fishing boats run aground. Freight traffic is forced to reroute, making the trade of rice and grain a difficult endeavor, and local market prices have spiraled into chaos.\n\nSome boatmen have already left in groups, seeking work downstream. The old saying returns to popular memory: “Where boats cannot go, the people do not dwell.”"
 haless.711.desc2: "Weeks of heavy rainfall have finally breached the weakened levees near [jiangszun_city_province.GetName]. Several downstream villages now lie underwater—paddy fields are thick with mud, homes have collapsed, and residents have fled for higher ground.\n\nThough not a catastrophic flood, the waters refuse to recede. Rumors of disease are spreading, and merchants have lost confidence in the region. Both cargo flow and tax income have plummeted."
 haless.711.a: "We should have repaired it sooner..."
 haless.711.b: "We can only try to contain the damage now..."
 haless.711.c: "We must draft a comprehensive restoration plan."

 haless_major_flooding: "Major Flooding"

 haless.712.t: "The Voice of the Field Assembly"
 haless.712.desc: "Among the villages of the Yanhe basin, it is common for Jiangszun farmers to form self-organized “Field Assemblies” (Tianhui) to discuss matters such as seasonal plowing, rotational irrigation, granary reserves, and grain tax allocations. Though lacking official recognition, these grassroots gatherings often exert significant influence on local agricultural planning.\n\nRecently, several such assemblies along the Yanhe have jointly submitted a petition. They request formal representation at the township level, with a seat at advisory councils to deliberate on waterworks, taxation, and the division of common lands.\n\nThis is not the first such proposal—nor is it isolated. As these assemblies become more stable across regions, their demands for institutional presence have grown. Some local officials support the idea, citing improved governance and cooperation. Others warn that such inclusion may disrupt the established power structure of towns and introduce new instability.\n\nShall we heed these voices from the fields?"
 haless.712.a: "Let the Tianhui speak."
 haless.712.b: "Absorb them quietly; appoint their leaders as officials."
 haless.712.c: "This is overreach. Suppress such assemblies."
 haless.712.d: "Ensuring the needs of the people comes first."

 haless.713.t: "Graceful Melodies by the Lakeside Stage"
 haless.713.desc: "The Celestial Lake lies in the midstream of the Yanhe, a smoky mirror nestled among the hills. Spanning several counties, it glistens with clear blue waves and scattered fishing boats—one of the most iconic sights in all of Yanshen.Towns along its banks thrive on the lake’s bounty. Fishing booms, and boats carry goods between markets and temples. Each year, as spring fades into early summer, and the lake winds turn mild, locals host the “Ten Days of Floating Theater.” Fishing halts, rafts are moored in the shallows, and commoners and nobles alike gather on the shores to watch plays performed over the water.\n\nThese plays are drawn from Jiangszun legends, river spirit myths, and tales of the Blue Sashes. Their lyrics are refined, their gestures sharp. They have long transcended entertainment—becoming part of the cultural soul of Yanshen."
 haless.713.a: "Off we go to the show!"
 haless.713.b: "Keep an eye out for gifted lyricists and composers."
 haless.713.c: "I’ll write a scene myself."
 haless_opera_craze: "Opera Craze"

 haless.714.t: "The Great Weaving Exhibition"
 haless.714.desc: "A grand contest of silk weaving has begun along the Yanhe, drawing together renowned artisans and master weavers from across the land. The event features two stages: a public exhibition of submitted samples and a final jury review. Brilliant ribbons cross the air, and patterns shimmer in the lamplight, stopping passersby in their tracks. The techniques on display span a rich spectrum. Some excel in tightly woven fabrics with intricate, enduring motifs. Others favor airy, flowing textures that dance with light. A few bold workshops introduce experimental methods, blending dyed threads or incorporating mixed materials for dazzling new effects.\n\nCrowds gather, debate erupts—awed spectators, artisans, and merchants dispute the merits of each style. Now that the contest has concluded, one style has emerged triumphant...or perhaps all have"
 haless.714.a: "The structured traditional weave wins the day."

 haless.715.t: "A Fearsome Administrator"
 haless.715.desc: "In recent years, a gifted administrator trained in eunuch academies has gained renown. Skilled in tax calculation and judgment, he has, in three years, reorganized granaries, surveyed lands, repaired canals, and reformed labor and levy rules—each task meticulously overseen to completion.\n\nGrain yields have risen, rivers run clear, and accounts balance. Merchants and assemblymen praise him: \"Ten years' work in three—truly a statesman.\"\n\nSome urge his methods be compiled into a new Administrative Canon; others see him as a model to solve the shortage of capable officials.\n\nYet concerns grow. Power concentrated in his hands leaves little oversight; he commands appointments, levies, decrees, and judgments alone. One warns, \"A eunuch may nourish the vessel; but if he becomes the lifeblood, who restrains him?\" Another says, \"When rule by man outweighs rule by law, statutes bend to one will.\"\n\nShall his authority be embraced and spread, or curbed before excess takes root? The choice is yours."
 haless.715.a: "Promote his system; let all officials learn from it."
 haless.715.b: "Grant him a title, and embed his practices into law."
 haless.715.c: "No administration should depend on one man."

 haless.716.t: "Harsh Eunuch, Heavy Taxation"
 haless.716.desc: "In recent years, in the province of [eunuchs_province.GetName], a eunuch administrator has taken over local administration. Under the banner of \"rectifying tax rolls and cleansing corruption,\" he has quickly erased fiscal deficits. However, his methods are brutal — levying excessive taxes, seizing merchant ledgers, and meddling in private trade and inheritance. Rumors suggest he enslaves the poor and seizes warehouses for personal use. The markets lie quiet; travelers detour the region.\n\nA popular saying spreads: \"Beneath the hat lies only bone,\" mocking his homely appearance and ruthless actions. Even local elites and Tianlou's Xuezhefang have joined voices in protest, accusing him of abusing authority and oppressing the people.\n\nThe eunuch defends himself: “To fear public unrest is to abandon the duties of governance. If discipline falters, the whole bureaucracy will collapse.” His tone veils a warning — punish him too harshly, and others may avoid civil service altogether.\n\nShall we value his results, or root out a growing rot?"
 haless.716.a: "Dismiss him and investigate the charges."
 haless.716.b: "Let him be."
 haless.716.c: "Launch a legal crackdown to set an example."

 haless.717.t: "The Flowing Years Poetry Assembly"
 haless.717.desc: "The Yanzhong region has long been the heart of Jiangszun's poetic tradition, where styles meet and talents flourish.\n\nTo the west, poetry rings bold and sorrowful—of metal, stone, and far frontiers. To the east, verses flow with elegance and feeling, painting nature and emotion. Though distinct, these traditions thrive together: poets trade verses across the winds and debate meaning, enriching a shared spirit.\n\nAs the realm grows, new lands bring fresh voices. Once-unknown regions now yield poets of note, each with their own dialects, imagery, and sensibilities. Scholars collect and annotate these works, preserving a bloom that transcends any single school.\n\nIn recent years, poetry has flourished across Yanshen—from Jiangszun masters to Beikling singers, Naamjyut forest poets to Szitu lyricists, fine verse spreads far.\n\nNow a new movement rises: the Yanshen Grand Poetry Assembly—an ambitious gathering to celebrate the finest works of this age."

It is said that the poems of this land were once passed down directly by the Dragon Emperor, and among all the poetry traditions of Yanshen, none are older.Their verses resound with strength, their language is dense and solemn. Some lament the life of soldiers stationed far from home, evoking the snow and desolation of the frontier; others tell of the hardships of the common folk, laboring in the fields, weathering the years.\n\nThis year, officials traveled across the borderlands to collect verses both old and new. What they gathered has spread far and wide —Some echo the fading laments of garrison soldiers, piercing the soul;Some weep with the sorrow of women and scholars, each word deeply felt;\n\nSome speak the thoughts of boatmen, plain and true.What poem was recorded this year?\n\nPerhaps within it lies the heart of the borderfolk — and the pulse of Yanshen itself."

Scholars and poets meet to recite and discuss; salons gather by lakeside pavilions, and verse contests enliven city outskirts. East of Yanzhong, the style grows ever more delicate, skilled in evoking feeling and depicting scene — the quiet of forests and mountains, the stillness of lantern light behind drawn curtains. The language is gentle yet firm, the sentiment distant yet unmelancholy, drawing emotion from landscape and setting ambition beyond the material.\n\nVerses drift through open windows, spoken by farmers and woodcutters alike. Scholars compete to record fine lines; literary societies praise new works. Even in boudoirs and among children at play, stanzas are easily recalled. The flourishing of “eastern verse” now rivals the classical tradition.\n\nThis year’s chosen works range from tender and graceful to ethereal and serene, or bright and self-contained.

Here, people live armed, their lives bound with defense and culture. Between fortresses and harbors, the region breeds loyal warriors and heartfelt poetry.\n\nThe people are earnest; their customs embrace song and verse, often expressing joy and sorrow. The Yuefu form prevails, with five-syllable lines shaping deep reflection. Each year, wind sweeps from the north, the rustling grass like clashing armor. Soldiers hear the braying of horses in the night — echoes of battles past.\n\nAs before, officials collect songs to preserve the people's voice. This year's melodies from military villages and mountain hamlets are stirring — old words sung anew, filled with sorrow and pride.

Its people excel in mining and tea-making, known since old as \"land of ancient iron and mountain tea, between fire and cold spring.\"\n\nThough remote, their literary spirit endures. Beikling folk are strong and sharp, favoring seven-syllable verse, vigorous and lofty. Some liken forest and mountain to steadfast solitude; others reflect on mines, casting truths of human rise and fall with concise force. Each line is like molten iron — powerful, rugged, noble, distinct from softer southern rhymes.\n\nThis year, scholars met in conclave, compiling Seven Syllables of the Black Mist Hills to honor the snowy range. Their words are solemn, fiery, like ore in the forge or frost on granite — carrying the resolve of ice and flame, the hearts of iron and stone.

Insights appear in parallel couplets, often in the fu style — structured, symbolic, yet never ostentatious.\n\nGanggim prose may detail ship mechanics or water flow with clarity; explore celestial instruments and astronomy with order; or wander mountains and rivers, using metaphor for philosophy. Every couplet matches, every word is placed with care. Their work prizes reason over emotion, innovation without losing grace — a rigorous, distinct current in Yanshen letters.\n\nThis year, scholars on the coast compiled a hundred new fu.

The great schools of the Xianjie realm each claim their territory here, befriending through blade, debating through path — earning the land the name: \"the realm of martial clans.\"\n\nHere, poetry does not follow rigid rules. Scholars draw from swordplay to compose their verses — in mountain wanderings or drunken debates, brush strokes fall into place. Their lines do not chase rhyme or couplets, nor cling to regulated tones. They seek only to express will and emotion — where thought leads, words follow. Some shout their grief, some proclaim joy; some lament the vast heavens, others swear upon life and death. These are called the “short verses” of the martial world.\n\nTheir poems are free yet ordered, rising like a sudden wind, running like a rainbow's arc. A single page may hold a lifetime of feeling; a few words can seal the heart. As they say in the martial world:\n\"One who has no fixed form but holds true spirit — that is the true Xia.\"\n\nThis year's Xianjie poetry gathering was held atop a cliff. Disciples from many sects came to present their verses. Some wrote of parting from friends, others of honor repaid with bold action, others of secluded practice among lonely peaks. Their tones are proud, serene, solemn — each worthy of being passed down among the Jianghu.\n\nThree such verses now rise to the forefront, all widely acclaimed.\n\nBut tell us — which of them best represents the spirit of a true Xia this year?"

This region has long served as both frontier defense and a haven for migrants — a place of both cultivation and conflict. Old forts lie in ruin, the flames of war extinguished, yet the land still waits for revival.\n\nRecently, a retired military settler in his sixties gathered old comrades and kin to reclaim a patch near a ruined border fortress. They dug irrigation canals, diverted a tributary of the Yanhe, and raised earthen dams and wooden bridges. Over ten families have now settled, bringing their own oxen and tools to build homes and till fields — a budding village in the making.\n\nThis has now caught the attention of local officers. Some praise their \"diligence in both defense and cultivation,\" hailing them as examples for frontier recovery. Others, however, warn of disorder if unofficial settlement continues without state sanction.\n\nA border commander now petitions the court: should we recognize this act of reclamation, grant official registration, and award them state farmland as a reward for their self-driven frontier revival?"

Martial gatherings are a common tradition: at seasonal festivals, villagers compete in bouts held before temple courtyards or inside walled compounds.\n\nThese duels are not simply tests of strength but follow inherited codes of respect and technique — bowing before each match, ceasing before injury. Lineages are preserved through master-disciple registers, earning this region the name \"Crucible of the North.\"\n\nRecently, a routine meet was disrupted by a military officer, claiming “unauthorized assembly” and \"disrupting order.\" In the resulting scuffle, a young martial artist was injured, nearly inciting a riot. Since then, unrest has stirred among the fortress towns.\n\nThe elder master who led the gathering has submitted a petition, asking for official recognition of these martial societies. He proposes a registry system and oversight to integrate them under state rule — preserving traditions while preventing disorder.\n\nShall we legitimize this legacy of blades and discipline?"

Bianfang, the western bastion, fields swift, iron-willed troops; Szicheng, in the heartland, houses the Grand War Camp; Jiantsiang defends the fertile northeast with strict order against nomads. Gushibi, seat of the Stone Army Alliance, gathers mercenaries; Jiangdu, the \"City of Warlords,\" holds supreme command and is famed for rigorous drills; Damaogong, on the Halberd Plains, trains infantry skilled at breaking cavalry.\n\nThough united under central command, the six long differed in systems and drills. Now, with order restored, the \"Six-Army Review\" rotates officers to compare doctrines: Jiangdu seeks clearer duties; Szicheng and Jiantsiang refine east-west readiness; Bianfang and Damaogong plan joint drills; Gushibi urges merging mercenaries into border forces.\n\nIf they act as one, joint warfare may revive; if mismanaged, reform may stall.

They expelled the herders and sought formal land registration, sparking widespread outrage. Surrounding villagers protested, some even arming themselves.

Their descendants shaped the region's “frontier norm.”\n\nToday, Shuvuush riders roam the highlands, descendants of the Heavenly Kingdom farm by the lake, and treasure fleets trade year-round. The border remains active, and interethnic marriages—though now rarer—quietly persist in garrisons and villages, accepted under the saying: “each village keeps its own ways.”\n\nBut in one settlement, a cluster of such marriages recently drew public notice. As word spread, debate erupted.\n\nSome praise the practice as binding hearts and fostering border peace. Others, especially gentry voices, call for restraint to protect household order.\n\nMore critical voices denounce it as a loss of propriety, warning: “if the heart flows like water, the levee will break.”"

As the day approaches, fish-patterned lanterns are strung across streets, red silk knots tied to prows. Open-air stages are built; salty sea ballads ring out as street performers entertain crowds. At alley corners, fishers hold the “Shell Banquet” with salt-boiled seafood and rice brew to welcome guests.\n\nTraveling merchants set up stalls, selling foreign textiles and spices. Teahouses and cloth halls open so-called 'Dressing Booths' for curious shoppers to don imitation foreign fashions—each stranger and more vibrant than the last.\n\nThis year, the festival coincides with the docking of a grand Northern Ocean fleet.

Yet these hybrid designs defy guild-approved patterns and materials, drawing veteran criticism for \"violating order and tradition.\"\n\nOrganizers, caught between innovation and tradition, petition the local council for funds to build test platforms, score entries, and record the best for port use.

Called \"Lantern-Curtain Ridges,\" they are clear-bodied and faintly luminous at night, admired by travelers and poets. While ideas to use them for various alchemical or magical purposes have surfaced before, they were seldom pursued.\n\nNow, several workshops have revived the plan, proposing a small \"Jellyfish Pen\" in the old port bay for short-term keeping and study, exploring their alchemical potential. Their bells might serve as membranes for vessels or veils for concealment tools; potion-makers test their flesh-like material in brews.\n\nSupporters hail this as a bold step blending arcane craft and living matter; critics warn of fishing disruption, hazards, imbalance, or toxins.

Inland, village carpenters have been tinkering with old mining bellows and stream pulleys, gradually devising a prototype \"pressure-spray rotor\" in hopes of using water power to propel simple wooden boats upstream.\n\nThough these ideas are far from fully realized, they've already stirred lively discussion among workshops and societies across the Yanshen Coast. Lantern-makers boast of height, weavers praise translucence, and carpenters argue over rotation speed—yet all say the same: \"The craft may be unshaped, but the intent is clear.\" Technique moves like the wind, and its sparks are slowly lighting the hills and shores.

By night, the light floods the hall like moonlight and can be seen from mountain paths and the village below, earning it the title \"Beacon of the North.\"\n\nInscriptions line the temple's stone walls, but none living can decipher them. The Perpetual Offering school of High Philosophy once deemed this fire a symbol of reason born of flame, while locals claim it wards off night-spirits and mountain phantoms. Many stories swirl, but one truth remains: the flame has never gone out.\n\nLately, the outer temple has begun to weather and crumble. Officials suggest repairs to preserve it. You may leave it be, or fund its restoration—though doing so will not come cheap."

 haless.735.desc: "The House of Fire and Water in Luoyip is the most prestigious gathering of alchemists in the Yanshen Coast. It began as a collaboration between a few adventurers, ship doctors, and gunners from Ganggim who shared knowledge of medicines and weapons to assist explorers and border patrols. Over time, it grew into a hub for inventors, scholars, and engineers throughout the Yanshen Coast. Their arts focus on practical applications—healing wounds, wielding fire, navigating storms—and have become indispensable for seafarers, adventurers, militias, and trade caravans alike. Their works are famed for their effectiveness and reliability.\n\nRecently, the organizers of the House have submitted a petition requesting state funding for two goals: expanding their facilities for experiments and instruction, and publishing their work to attract more disciples from across the realm. Supporting them would foster further alchemical innovation and strengthen our nation's access to refined tools and medicines, crucial for long-distance expeditions."

 haless.736.desc: "Hidden Spring is a famed hot spring retreat in Yanshen, nestled in lush woodlands where steam gently coils above crystal-clear pools that never run dry. Since ancient times, it has drawn travelers, scholars, and officials seeking healing and peace of mind—many of whom lingered far longer than intended. Legend tells that Harimar himself, during his conquest of Yanshen, once bathed here for days, declaring the spring “a balm for the soul, water gifted from heaven,” and placed guards to protect it. Centuries later, Emperor Jaher of the Phoenix Empire also visited this spring during his campaign, and so it came to be called \"The Conqueror's Spring.\"\n\nToday, ancient rituals continue: incense is offered before entering the water, and paper is burned afterward—said to wash away both bodily afflictions and burdens of the mind.\n\nAs winter deepens and sunlight becomes rare, the rising mist shrouds the spring like fine gauze—it is the perfect time for a bath."

 haless.737.t: "Land of White Gold"
 haless.737.desc: "East of the Heavenly Lake lies a vast land of silver-white sheen stretching like a mirrored plain—this is the Bitter Sea, the largest salt flat in Yanshen. The parched lakebed stretches endlessly, coated year-round in salt frost. From afar, it gleams like snow-covered earth, and when the wind stirs, fine salt crystals dance in the air, dazzling under the sun. For centuries, this place has been famed for its salt production and remains one of the lifelines of Yanshen. \n\nPerched on the edge of the Bitter Sea is Sising—not honored by kings, but exalted by salt. Once home to the palace of the White Court Kings, its royal lords are long gone, but the palatial halls remain, bustling with merchant guilds and accounting houses. Where once stood a throne now sits the heart of the salt economy—contracts signed, ledgers tallied, and fortunes made.\n\nEach morning, lake winds sweep through its streets, carrying the dry tang of fine salt. Salt merchants stream in endlessly, and ox carts and riverboats keep the city pulsing day and night. Every trade here orbits the \"white gold.\" The salt produced is crystal-clear, smooth, and imperishable. Noble houses across the realms take pride in using it, dispatching envoys to buy in bulk or to construct salt vaults for yearly supply. Some whisper that Salt City's salt can \"temper breath and preserve cold,\" making it prized in both alchemy and spiritual cultivation—adding a mystic aura to its renown.\n\nThrough the passage of time and the steadiness of governance, Sising is no longer merely a city born of salt. It has become a crossroads of wealth, a waypoint for merchants and travelers, and a stage where institutions contend with markets. A thousand hands once lifted salt crystals from the sea of hardship—those same hands have raised this city, rising from wind, sand, and pale light."

 haless.738.desc: "The Luzhang Baota, located in Yingzhen, has long stood as a symbol of peace and remembrance in Yanshen.\n\nSince its construction in 1202, its beacon has never dimmed. Legends claim that the eternal flame reflects both the thoughts of the dead and the wishes of the living. During the Festival of the Moon, thousands gather to burn incense and light lanterns, creating a tide of light across the mountain city.\n\nIn the past, stewardship of the tower fell to the Luzhang Order, founded by oath-bound monks and exiled scholars. They maintained the rituals and safeguarded the tower's peace, vowing to \"guard the souls of the dead and soothe the hearts of the living.\"\n\nBut in troubled times, a faction of assassins seized influence in Yingzhen, covertly usurping the Order. Though the tower appeared sacred, its shadows concealed knives. Preachers whispered secrets, and the once-holy site became a center of subterfuge and intelligence.\n\nNow, Yingzhen has long been under our rule. The city is stable, and the Order has officially broken free from clandestine control. Yet rumors persist. Some within the old Order petition to restore its original mandate; local elites argue for a full restructuring under civil authority; others suggest leaving things be to avoid unrest.\n\nThe flame atop Luzhang still burns—but which path should its light now illuminate?"

However, with technological advances and new supplies arriving from Beikling and the Pugao Mountains, a new wave of gemstone craftsmanship has begun to flourish across Yanshen.\n\nArtisans now employ advanced gold-wire filigree inlays and carved flower engravings, producing ornamental jade pieces in the distinct local style.

Without herald or escort, he appeared in the heart of court. No greetings. No requests for audience. Only one message:\n\n“I will deliver your enemy's head.”\n\nHe asks for little—some minor tools to ease the path and a humble reward. Yet it is precisely this matter-of-fact tone that lends weight to his offer. Whispers swirl: Can such a man be controlled once let loose?

They are said to belong to the infamous lineage of the Unseen Killers.\n\nThey leave no name, seek no ransom—only the certainty of death. Even elite bodyguards have fallen unconscious in the split second before the strike.\n\nIf this figure truly comes for one of ours, then guards and palace walls may prove meaningless.

New talents rise. Even the most venerable sects may find challengers at their gates.Recently, a little-known sect defeated a representative of an established orthodoxy during a regional duel. Riding the wave of victory, they now demand to take the elder sect's place in the Register. Outrage ensues—the old sect protests, the new insists.\n\nThis matter has reached Hero Isle's provincial administration. Officials are torn: Should tradition be upheld, preserving the dignity of the old name? Or should merit decide status, letting the new sect rise? Or perhaps a middle way—granting the newcomers a side position, and watching what comes next?\n\nA single decree will decide the fate of a sect. All eyes are watching."

 haless.745.t: "Beyond the Sect Walls, Within Human Rule?"
 haless.745.desc_xia: "In the bygone days of the Xianjie, martial sects stood in great numbers, each forming their own order amid the mountains and rivers. Back then, the Wulin had yet to be unified — sects across the land formed a loose alliance, guided by an elected Grandmaster who mediated disputes and repelled threats, yet held little sway over the internal affairs of each sect.\nNow, the martial world is gradually unified. The Path of Unity has been implemented for years, and the old barriers between sects are slowly being dismantled. Internal rules and governance are being integrated into the broader legal framework. Even so, some sects remain steeped in old customs and have yet to fully submit to centralized rule.\nRecently, a fugitive has taken shelter under the authority of a certain sect within the Xianjie. Rumors claim the sect not only harbors the criminal, but has even accepted them as a disciple. The sect makes no effort to conceal this, instead invoking an old precedent — \"redemption through devotion\" — as a time-honored tradition.\nThe magistrates seek to carry out an arrest in accordance with the law, but the sect has quietly issued a warning: \"None may cross the gates uninvited.\"\nThis has sparked widespread debate — should old traditions be tolerated in the name of peace? Should this be a moment of reckoning, to bring errant sects fully under the law? Or might a personal envoy of the Path of Unity intervene, reasoning with the sect to yield in dignity without escalation?"
 haless.745.desc_other: "In the lands of the Western Territories, it has long been customary that \"sects serve in place of the state.\" Across the region, local sects manage forests and settlements generation after generation—training disciples, maintaining order, settling disputes, and providing moral instruction.\n\nThough nominally under national rule, internal affairs are often dictated by sect law, forming self-contained systems.Now, a wanted fugitive has crossed into these lands and is said to have been taken in by a local sect—possibly even accepted as a disciple. The sect claims this is an old custom: \"Many have atoned through service; this is nothing new.\"\n\nLocal authorities demand immediate arrest per national law. The sect, however, warns against \"violating the sacred boundary of the sect wall.\"\n\nThe matter sparks intense debate:\n\nShould the state respect local tradition and avoid conflict, upholding the law and assert authority over all? Or should it seek compromise, earning cooperation through diplomacy rather than force?"

This trend, originating from the streets, has begun to seep into the ranks of officials and scholars alike.\n\nThe disciples of Xianjie are not silent in the face of this—some respond with cold indifference, others with outspoken anger. Mutual resentment is growing more pronounced by the day. If such tensions are left unchecked, they may deepen into a serious rift.\n\nOfficials now debate in the halls: should prejudiced speech be strictly forbidden, affirming the principles of unity?

These stories were once mere idle tales at dinner tables, but with Yanshen and Xianjie now united, what was distant lore now feels tangible, the ancestral homeland within reach.\n\nRecently, a Yanshen-descended clan living in Szitu has submitted a formal request to the authorities. They claim to have identified their ancestral lands and seek permission to return, resettle, rebuild ancestral graves, and continue their heritage. Their appeal is respectful and heartfelt—stating this is not defection but a sacred duty to their roots.\n\nLocal sects dare not decide lightly.
