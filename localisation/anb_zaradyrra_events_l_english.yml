 zaradyrra.0.title:0 "Being an Ashhana" #placeholder
 zaradyrra.0.desc:0 "All Ashhana struggle to control the Blood Curse, and art is the key to control. The Canvas faction focus on artistic performances - intricate dance, beautiful music, performative sculpture, and so on. Creating this kind of art is most effective for control, but reserved for the elite - commoners can get some benefit from comsuming such art. The Claw faction focus on a different kind of art - inflicting suffering. They ritualise bloodletting, use elaborate war chants, and generally inflict violence indiscriminately, but preferably upon non Ashhana. This is rather distateful to Canvas, but they cannot deny it is more effective for common Ashhana in holding back the blood curse." #placeholder

 zaradyrra.10.title:0 "Performance: Embroidery"
 zaradyrra.10.desc:0 "Foreigners might look at an Ashhana’s embroidery and scoff. How does this do anything more than calm one person’s soul, they say? Well, those in these lands that perform embroidery have been shrugging off such questions for a long time. Working almost in a blur of limbs, string, and needles, the artisans compose any design the audience or scholars can think of. Is a tree desired? It will be made. What of something more solemn? It too can be embroidered. Unless it fails to calm the soul or worsens the Blood Curse, no demand is too great, nor is any prompt infeasible.\n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"
 zaradyrra.10.a:0 "How can we not be inspired?"

 zaradyrra.11.title:0 "Performance: Weapon Demonstration"
 zaradyrra.11.desc:0 "The Ashhana know well that at times war is a necessity. They do not dare sit in complacency or accept a lack of preparation. The crafting of weapons through metalwork is thus one of the sacred Hundred Petals. Confident in the virtue of their task, blacksmiths prepare their weapons with humble devotion. They are paired with warriors known for their restraint and patience, who then test the forged weapons for all to witness. The audience watches and learns. When such a display comes to the village, one or two youths are inevitably inspired to work as blacksmiths themselves.\n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"

 zaradyrra.12.title:0 "Performance: Rhythmic Blade Dance"
 zaradyrra.12.desc:0 "Our finest warriors stand to arms as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] watches with rapt attention, refusing to be distracted by the muttering of distant scholars, always in dispute as to whether the Blood Curse is actually being helped at all by performances such as these. Drawing their blades, the warriors dance in ever-more complex formations, sometimes treading carefully as if on quicksand, sometimes rampaging in memory and condemnation of the worst excesses of the Blood Curse. Calming their souls and fortifying the resolve of those they defend, the soldiers - nay, artists - turn their blades into extensions of themselves. \n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"
 zaradyrra.12.a:0 "How can we not be inspired?"
 
 zaradyrra.13.title:0 "Performance: Sand Mandala"
 zaradyrra.13.desc:0 "The tradition of the Colors of Life finds a great and truly noble manifestation when it is brought to life in a manner truly befitting the Great Cycle. On a patch of sand, what a foreigner might call “mandala” takes shape. Flower petals and natural paints, the gifts of Zakytzkaras, lend color to what might otherwise be a simple feat of geometry. Thus the Great Cycle blooms in the minds of those that watch. \n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"
 zaradyrra.13.a:0 "How can we not be inspired?"
 
 zaradyrra.14.title:0 "Performance: Tool Decoration Ceremony"
 zaradyrra.14.desc:0 "The complaint is simple: the tools look drab and uninspired. Once they had surely been elegant in their simplicity, but the fact is that as they are they are no fit manifestation of the Zakytzkaras.\n\nAn artist, guided by the joint efforts of scholars of the Humble Zeal and the Colors of Life, assumes responsibility for fixing this problem. With a mix of solemnity and great joy, artist and audience join in a cacophony of voices, figuring out together what the colors of the tools shall be, and what ornamentation shall adorn them.\n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"
 zaradyrra.14.a:0 "How can we not be inspired?"
 
 zaradyrra.15.title:0 "Performance: Creating Tools, Then Using Them"
 zaradyrra.15.desc:0 "One by one the petitioners – civilians, merchants, soldiers, nobles – are brought forward to speak to the artisans and their scholarly advisors. Some of their needs are met by that which has already been made; some the scholars of the Humble Zeal and the Great Cycle see a need to devise a tool anew. But to the wonderment of the audience, no problem proves too great or too petty to have a tool made. As each tool is refined and put to use by their new owners, inspiration spreads. \n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"
 zaradyrra.15.a:0 "How can we not be inspired?"
 
 zaradyrra.16.title:0 "Performance: Music from Natural Instruments"
 zaradyrra.16.desc:0 "Which Ashhana dares forget what saved us from the demonic hags and their vile blood curse, breaking us from our cycle of darkness? It was the music of nature - the soul song brought about by natural music backing the desperate voice of a lone war-bard. Today we bring that venerable tradition to life: today we show forth that even the stones will cry out the glory of the Zakytzkaras. And amidst their song and the Great Cycle, we will build the 333rd Empire in this, our beloved land.\n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"
 zaradyrra.16.a:0 "How can we not be inspired?"
 
 zaradyrra.17.title:0 "Performance: Synchronized Smithing"
 zaradyrra.17.desc:0 "So often the creation of art requires the humility to admit that one cannot go it alone, that one needs others around to produce something truly worthy. There is no greater manifestation of this humility than in the tradition of synchronised smithing. The smiths in a given province begin their work all at once, and time their strikes and labour with one another, creating a hymn out of what the unenlightened would merely call cacophony. They begin together and complete their art together, creating metalwork without pareil in its beauty and sacredness.\n\n[GetZaradyrraDeityText]"

 zaradyrra.30.desc:0 "The first reports coming from [This.GetName] speak of disorder and violence. Ashhana provinces have never been easy to hold, due the population living under the constant strain of the Blood Curse. As their communal ties loosen under non-Ashhana rule, many Ashhana tribesmen drift into roaming war bands, striking without strategy or demands. They attack farms, roads, and isolated garrisons alike, then scatter, driven by the searing impulse of their curse.\n\nIt will take time for Ashhana to regain their equilibrium and reduce the number of Blood Curse incidents in [This.GetName]. Until that happens, local villagers will fear for their life and the infrastructure will be left to deteriorate among the rampaging Ashhana Lizardfolk."
