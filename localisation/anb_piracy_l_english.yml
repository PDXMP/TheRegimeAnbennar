 anb_piracy.1.d:0 "For years now, the Ruined Sea has been host to no end of scallywags, buccaneers and pirates seeking their own fortunes and legends and writing their bloody tale into the waters of the sea. None have stood out quite as famously as Thirendil Windsail. A handsome, charming and elegant man who could draw a pistol or blade faster than most could draw breath, he possesses a wit and tactical mind to match.\n\nFrom his daring raids of Asraport to heroic escapes from the leech-infested waters of the Leechdens and his legendary claim of having captured a ship from every power that sailed in his seas, the tales of this pirate occupy every tavern from Cestirmark to Bulwar. Best the records dare to tell, Thirendil is a Sea Elf, one of the enigmatic peoples who refused to settle with Munas or Jaher in Cannor or Bulwar, but sought to remain on the seas forever more… Except the Windsail is not with his people, instead exiled to sail the oceans away. No record of why can be found by any.\n\nWhat are recorded are endless tales of gallantry, charm, honor and cheer and the winning of the hearts of a thousand dames and gentlemen from Cestirmark to Ozgarom. Thirendil has amassed a reputation rivaled only by a few other legendary pirates that stalk the seas and a fleet of incredible size, comprising countless captured vessels, to all of which he offered a fair chance to surrender and never infringed upon the sacred art of parley.\n\nNews has reached our highest command of his recent take-over and settlement of a small island in the Ruined Sea, his fleet finally having grown too large for him to directly command and sail. It seems the decision to establish a Piratical state has been made by Thirendil and his most trusted captains. This new republic - ‘Rhasáil’ as he dubs it, meaning ‘Free Island’ - promises itself to be a land of liberty, profit, honor and adventure, though many see it as an extension of the tumor of piracy onto the seas of Aelantir and all of Halann."

 anb_piracy.2.d:0 "The skies of the Ruined Sea have been darkened recently. These seas, born as they were out of a calamity that changed the world forever, have long proven dangerous and mysterious. Another oddity or foul horror upon its waters would not prove surprising, if not for its nature and particularly despicable form.\n\nFrom Cannor has sailed a man whose zealotry and fanaticism has shocked even the most devout of even his particular heresy: Trystan of Shell Shallows, worshiper of the primordial god of the seas, Uelos. Trystan was persecuted and chased away from his home of Uelaire by concerned and horrified clergy, disappearing with several stolen ships and vanishing westward. For years, this was believed to be the end of their threat… until he and his fleet of cultists were seen again, sailing towards an uninhabited island.\n\nSummary reports have returned to us of mysterious and bizarre activity on the island which they have taken. These reports speak of odd and unnatural storms which repel any who try and approach, an increase in the agitation of the monsters of the sea which spares only the ships of these new colonists, and most concerningly of all… entire ships disappearing, all their plunder, crew and passengers vanishing into the cold and dark of the sea.\n\nOne of the smaller vessels of this new venture was recently captured, and the men aboard interrogated, with only the slightest information being gleaned… the prisoners told tales of horrific human sacrifices, of foul and profane magics, rituals to create horrific man-beasts with unnatural powers - and that is only the beginning. This cult, which we now know as ‘Lamentaire’ are more than just normal pirates, they are a cult of unimaginable horror, and already advisors clamor for us to stamp out this latest Piratical menace."

 anb_piracy.3.d:0 "The taverns and bars around the Ruined Sea aren’t strangers to stories of monsters and tales of horrible creatures lurking in the seas, and hells - half of them are even true. What is new is the very real tale of a fleet of ships lurking in the murky fog, of echoing voices chanting tales of their own agonizing deaths at the hands of a man who spoke no words, holding only greed and hate in his heart.\n\nMore and more these fantastical tales reach the ears of the powers that be within our realm, as the distressed viceroys assure any who listen that these tales are the truth, that this latest batch of pirates in the Ruined Sea wield magics to tear the soul of those unfortunate enough to be faced with the grasping fog. Such victims are destined to forever maintain the vessels that brought them doom, until they are finally released, dispersing into a sickly green smog which hides the escape of these piratical menaces.\n\nOur best reports only tell us very little of this enigmatic band of brigands, but they tell of a man, a Gerudian Reaver by the name of Vebjorn “the Quiet”, accompanied by a cabal of enigmatic mages wearing white, who - along with his ‘pet’ troll - sailed away from Dalr in the cold of night, leaving only a bloodied dock and empty shipyards in his wake. This mystery found its answer in reports from the states of the Trollsbay, of vessels happily plundering up and down their home waters.\n\nThis group, ‘Trollshaunt’ as they’ve come to be known, both for the necromantic specters which follow their vessels and for their near exclusive targeting of Trollsbayer ships, proves another sign of the metastasis of the sickness of piracy through the Ruined Sea, another Piratical Republic to trouble the waters of the sea… and it’s sailors' souls, who shudder in fear, listening close in the wind for the melody of the Ol’ Cap’s Shadow."

 anb_piracy.4.t:0 "The Founding of Port Palegold"
 anb_piracy.4.d:0 "A tale most confusing and dramatic has reached the ears of the persons of power in our realm, a tale which starts with two heretics and a heist. In Cannor, a botched robbery of imperial relics from Anbenncóst revealed a deep and intricate network of criminals and hidden crimes linked to the Shadow Council, the mysterious power brokers behind Nathalaire.\n\nIt seems the two thieves responsible for the failed caper, Adeline of Thiefgallows and Maurise síl Ebenaire, are both followers of the widely reviled heresy of Nathalaranism - the belief that Ara, goddess of fortune, has entered into a secret romance with the former avatar of the Dame and goddess of thieves, secrets and shadows, Nathalyne. Having realized the import of what they let slip, they have promptly fled west to Aelantir. The partners and lovers now make even grander plans, longing to turn this defeat into a glorious victory.\n\nTheir voyage was followed by many of their old associates, both within their heresy and the criminal underworld. They soon found themselves in possession of enough wealth, talent and skill to marshal the takeover of a small island, having forged an alliance with a band of rogue artificers. With fortune stacked in their favor and a home to call their own, they went to work plundering the riches of the continent, from relics of the precursor elves to Amadian silver.\n\nThis tale, charming and dramatic as it is, proves to be another sign of the increasing growth of piracy in the Ruined Sea, and who can tell what dangers a group of fringe religious devotees and mad artificers could achieve left to their own devices, in their very own Piratical republic… Port Palegold, as it has come to be called."
