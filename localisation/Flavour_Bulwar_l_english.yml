 bulwar_flavour.1.d:0 "The lands that have been occupied by the gnolls for so long are now no longer in their control, which allows for the return of the Surani people to the land they fled from so long ago. Groups of them have been spotted trying to return 'home'. This has caused some stir. Should we allow them to return to their lands?"

 bulwar_flavour.2.t:0 "An Offer of Help"
 bulwar_flavour.2.d:0 "An elven warrior has appeared in our court. He calls himself by the name of Kamnaril of the Sands. Supposedly he claims to be a Jaddari officer, the son of a veteran of Jaher's conquests. He speaks of a different take our relationship to Surakel. While the Sun Elves would have us believe that only they can fulfill the duties of the deceased god, Kamnaril speaks of how the Jaddari see that all who are faithful can take the burden of Surakel. He proposes a world wherein we are no longer subservient to the sun elves."

 bulwar_flavour.3.da:0 "A group of missionaries has appeared in our country. They speak of a new religion, one that promotes tolerance of all races. This 'Jadd' they speak of has them organise in their own communes and do work in the name of their sun god. They even have started preaching on the street to anyone who would listen, saying that the darkness in their hearts must be banished and that all are welcome within the light of 'Surael'. More and more are starting to listen to them. Can we really let this continue?"
 bulwar_flavour.3.db:0 "A group of missionaries has appeared in our country, speaking heresy. They claim that Surael has not really entrusted the Sun Elves with his duties and that instead his duties fall to everyone who follows his light. They are encouraging the peasants to take more and more power into their own hands. This is disturbing the public order! Can we really let this continue?"

 bulwar_flavour.5.d:0 "While we try to live harmoniously with other races, politics and ambition brings out the worst in people. A political rivalry in [Root.GetName] has spiraled out of control to the point where one sought to use the other's racial heritage against them, starting a slander campaign against all members of his kind.

His tanned skin and pale hair go combined with garb that say he is one of the Jaddari, remnants of Jaher's legions that became desert warriors and turned towards a strange faith. Shall we take him on as our commander? He might be a great help in our wars."

The people in [target_province.GetName] have seen the treatment of their brethren within the Jadd and accepted Surael's light.

Already new local communities are forming around the organisation of the Jadd faith. Among them are pockets of zealous warriors only all to eager to serve their faith in whatever way their leaders ask of them.

 #Rebuilding the Ekluzagnu

 rebuild_the_stone_palace_desc:0 "Ekluzagnu, the Stone Palace, lies in ruins. The prestigious, ornate fortress, the center of states that have come and gone for millennia has long served as a symbol of dominance over the Šad Sur. Were we to revitalize the wonder, it would create a trophy that proves our legitimacy, and solidify our grasp on the region."
 bulwar_flavour.26.t:0 "Rebuilding the Ekluzagnu"
 bulwar_flavour.26.d:0 "A quick loop of the mountain on horseback makes clear the nature of the fortress, of all that need be done. The swift bend of the Panuzagnu river cuts beneath the sheer cliff at the mountain's end, the old gate watchful in its long vigil over cloud-kissed peaks of the mountains beyond. The depths of the first citadel remain surprisingly well preserved, still decorated with murals boasting the feats of ancient Bulwari kings, even if they've been stripped of their valuable ornaments. The reason for the fortress's abandonment, however, lies clear in the scattered bones, the potsherds, the broken stones beyond the toppled gates that litter Galuibar -- the Demonscar.\n\nA rift melted through what seems a half a league of solid mountain, by Xhazobine's fury, the blackened gulch has long supplanted the old gate. With the sun shining bright down through the open wound in the stone above, the scene is laid bare. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stands amidst the vast rift, gazing down through a scar that had healed into a bustling way lined with dwellings, storefronts, temples, all the long-abandoned cogs that set a city turning. The scars of war seem fresh, even after centuries from arrows still embed in half-rotted posts, to stagnant pools of water beneath shattered aqueducts. The past weighs heavy, amidst the scattered stones of a gatehouse so laden with scars that it seemed to have been rebuilt a hundred times over. If the Ekluzagnu had fallen before, stripped from the Bulwari who first set chisel to stone, from Zehia, shattered by Xhazobine, from the Castanites, the folk of the Šad Sur... How can [Root.Monarch.GetName] hope to set the walls anew, see that their stones never crumble, as so many before?\n\nYet, the crossroad stands at a crossroads. Shall we exploit this progress to turn it to an impenetrable fortress, or stand upon the shoulders of this splendid progress to make it a palace, a monument to our glory?"

 bulwar_flavour.27.da:0 "While no city is built in a day, a mere decade seems as the blink of an eye, for how far we have come. Standing in the shattered ruin of the Galuibar gate a decade past, it seemed a hopeless task to restore a long-abandoned city crawling with squatters and monsters. And yet, the black gate stands tall. With its façade hewn from the black stone of the Demonscar, the imposing wall of stone stands in defiance of those who would consign this grand city to history. Even an experimental shot from one of our most powerful canons failed to leave an obvious proofmark in that stone gate. It looms over the sands, deep and dark as the void between the stars. Adorned in marble with fierce visages of snarling gnolls, the vigilant helms of the Bulwari, the Castanites, the Ekluzagnu displays the united will of all who have dwelt within its walls, all who ever shall, that it has stood proud two thousand years, and shall stand two thousand more.\n\nDownriver, the modest city of Suruzagnu had largely dominated the region, but the reconstruction of the Ekluzagnu has outpaced it in glory. Just as it flourished, so too blooms the 'little stone' of the stone palace. While the traders, diplomats, and sightseers are most often drawn to the now-bustling Galuibar's stone-hewn markets, the whole region grows prosperous, into an oasis in the overland route from Bulwar through the Salahad. The ancient dwellings, inhabited on and off for a thousand years now play host to shops that hawk exotic goods from the four corners of Halann, their patios draped in tapestries of elven silk that shield the market from the beating sun of the great rift above. The cries of exotic beasts, the smell of a thousand cuisines welcome weary travelers."

And yet, Ekluzagnu has bloomed into an oasis in every sense. An ancient spiral pipework that delves down to some hidden enclave at the river still faithfully pipes water through the citadel even after what must have been a thousand and odd years. It feeds a system of pipelike flows tucked away in the eaves of the caverns, which themselves feed crystal-clear pools of water scattered through the labyrinthine twists of the hand-hewn city. The few shafts of sunlight that peek in past the shattered crest of the mountain foster bountiful gardens, planters and hanging pots filled with topsoil from the fertile land downstream.

I travelled. I conquered. I remained ravenous. The First Sun rose, day after day, taunting me with its succulence. I could only imagine the perfect mix of sweetness and spice, dappling my tongue with its exotic flavours. But it remained stubbornly out of reach.\n\nI grew. I ate. I grew, because I ate. The more I eat, the more I shall grow - this is the logic. And I knew: I shall grow tall enough to reach the First Sun, and pluck it from the sky, and consume it bite-after-bite-after-bite. I shall quench my thirst with its fires. I shall end my hunger with its light.\n\nAnd, as I sought new feasts in these blaze-seasoned sands, I learned of another sun.\n\nThe scouts painted a vivid picture - one I committed to memory. He was tall, they said; his skin terracotta, his hair matching the desert he claimed. His pack revered him. His creed - some new perversion of the First Sun's dogma - was obeyed without question.\n\nHe knew of me, too. He sought to kill me. To end my dominion over these antique lands.\n\nThe thought of him gnaws at me. He walks these sands as if they bow to him, but the dunes remember their true master, and soon, so will he.

A clawed hand intercepts the strike, warping wood and iron and bone alike. Pain shoots up his arm, but Jaddar grits his teeth and swings with his off-hand, driving a dagger towards the beast’s side. It strikes true - barely. Zokka snarls, ripping the blade free with sickening ease.\n\nSpitting dust, Jaddar adjusts his stance. Zokka watches, head tilted slightly. The emerald gleam of his eyes is transparent; there is no taunting glint, or steely declaration. Only desire. Only hunger.\n\nHe breathes.\n\nAgain, Jaddar lunges. Again, Zokka is faster. As the gnoll steps to the side, the light breaks through in full force, blinding the Commander for a mortal moment. Zokka catches him mid-strike, shattering the spear and sinking his claws deep. Jaddar bites back a cry at the pain, twisting desperately in the grasp, but his enemy’s strength is absolute. He is lifted, as if he and his armour weigh nothing, feet kicking at the bloodying sand. Hot, putrid breath washes over his face. He meets the Pack Lord’s eyes.\n\nOnly desire. Only hunger.\n\nHas Surael betrayed him? Will the sands remember him? What will he leave behind?"

 zokka_jaddari_war.101.d: "When the news first arrived with a trader from Subkaliss, it was met with stunned disbelief, which soon gave way to cautious hope and frenetic jubilations. Zokka, the self-proclaimed Devourer-of-Suns, had met his end at the hands of the desert prophet Jaddar and his valiant Legion. The dread overlord of the devious Kog sisters was no more. This momentous event marked the first interruption in a seemingly inescapable downward spiral that seemed destined to end in the utter subjugation of the free people of Maqet and the extinction of their way of life - at the hands of the same gnollish threat their ancestors fled all these centuries ago.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] may be many things, but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is not such a fool that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will not grasp such a singular opportunity. This might well be the first and possibly last chance to reverse the course of history and regain the mainland lost to their ancestral Gnollish foe over a decade ago. A chance for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to restore [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] realm from a remote island to a proud kingdom once more. The choice before [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a difficult one, and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court is divided over the best course of action.\n\nShould [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] approach the self-proclaimed Herald of Surael, who after all has proven to be more than capable of dealing with the gnollish fiends, and request his support in our holy mission to reclaim the lands of Dasmazar from the cackling servants of the Dark, even if that support will surely come at a heavy price? Is [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] willing to give up our belief in the Way of Maqet, the unique way to Surakel that the Maqeti have maintained even in times of hardship ever since they journeyed to their new homeland? Should [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] accept the teachings of Jaddar as genuine revelation from Surakel? Or is this too much of a price to pay, forfeiting the tradition of centuries in hope of a better future? Have the Maqeti not always stood alone against the gnollish threat, and won many triumphs by the strength of their own arms alone?"
 zokka_jaddari_war.101.a: "Just as Jaher came to our aid long ago, his grandson shall surely support our righteous cause!"
 zokka_jaddari_war.101.b: "Surakel helps those who help themselves! Maqet is our past, our present and our future!"
 zokka_jaddari_war.101.tt: "Should the Jaddari Legion choose to grant their support we will be forced to convert to the Jadd"

 zokka_jaddari_war.102.t: "An Old Debt Claimed"
 zokka_jaddari_war.102.d: "The victory celebrations have only barely come to an end and the mood amongst the faithful is triumphant, but already the first signs have arrived that the outside world has taken note of our stunning victory over the servants of Darkness. Only yesterday an emissary from Dasmatuš, a small island state to the south of our newly claimed Gulf coastlands, has arrived at Ebbušubtu, sweating profusely in his ornate ceremonial garb and requesting an audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], the Herald of Surael. \n\nProstrating himself before [Root.Monarch.GetName], the emissary begins to extol the virtues of Jaddar’s grandfather Jaher, who once already saved their people from the gnollish servants of Malevolent Dark. In return Maqeti sailors proved instrumental in supplying Jaher’s Legions, even to the far end of Haless. Back then, however, their insistent pleas to divert at least some of the Phoenix Empire’s might south to decisively end the Gnollish threat in Sarhal fell on deaf ears, and with the death of Jaher all such plans had to be abandoned. Now the Gnolls are back, stronger and more vile than ever, and all the good works of Jaher and the Maqeti in containing their evil have been undone. There is, the emissary finishes, a debt of honor to be paid by the house of Jaher. It is time to renew the pact made by Jaddar’s grandfather once more, and with the unrest caused by the fall of Zokka, now is the time to strike. This time, he vows, the Gnolls shall be vanquished once and for all.\n\nThis bold demand, wrapped in an appeal to honor, has caused quite a stir amongst the inner circle of the Jaddari Legion. Some argue that it would be foolish to expend precious troops in a fight not our own. Our faith is young and we need all the men we can spare to protect it and its adherents from those beyond our new borders who are eager to see us fall. Their proponents have made it clear that as long as the Maqeti cling to their old ways and do not acknowledge the revelations Jaddar received from Surael Himself as truth, they cannot be considered true brothers in faith. Thus, they have no claim on our support for their holy war of reconquest unless they convert.\n\nTheir opponents point out the possible value of a grateful ally, sworn to the Way of Jaddar, guarding our southern flank. The rapacious and cruel daughters of Maxota have proven themselves to be unreliable neighbors at best, sending our emissaries away with the brusque reply that ‘there is no god but wealth, and the only good is profit’. Certainly, supporters of the Maqeti cause argue, it behooves the Herald of Surael to stand with fellow children of Surael against vile slavers, as long as they have accepted his teachings."
 zokka_jaddari_war.102.a: "A debt honored, a pact reforged - together we shall vanquish the forces of Darkness!"
 zokka_jaddari_war.102.b: "Jaher’s path is not the path of Jaddar, his grandfather’s debts are not his to settle."
 zokka_jaddari_war.102.tt: "§RAccepting them as allies and brothers in the faith will most likely mean we will soon have to fight against the gnolls holding the Dasmati mainland.§!"

 zokka_jaddari_war.103.t: "The Lone Warden"
 zokka_jaddari_war.103.d: "As it was in the beginning, so it is now. We stand alone once more against the forces of Darkness. No matter what some may have hoped for, aid from our brethren in the faith beyond the Salahad shall not be forthcoming. We alone protect the Garden of Surakel against all who would defile it. But we are not truly alone, for Surakel is with us, and with his Blessing we shall surely overcome the vile servants of Dark squatting in our ancestral homelands,chasing them back into the wilderness from whence they came from.\n\nThe port of Dasmatuš is a bustling beehive of activity, as smugglers are loaded with weapons caches destined for resistance cells on the mainland. Our chainbreakers rig their sails, preparing to board as many enemy trading vessels as it takes to bring the despicable slave trade out of Koggraffa to a screeching halt. Opportunistic mercenaries disembark to sign their contracts with the recruitment office, while bold merchants unload the raw materials required by the royal arsenal to replenish the depleted weapons depots, all in preparation for the actual invasion."
 zokka_jaddari_war.103.a: "With Surakel on our side, we shall surely triumph in the struggle to come!"

 zokka_jaddari_war.104.t: "A new Faith for a new Dawn"
 zokka_jaddari_war.104.d: "Our decision to seek the aid of the Jaddari has surely been blessed by Surael. Our emissary has been welcomed with open arms, and once more the Sons of Maqet stand proudly aside the rightful heir of the House of Jaher. Resentment may simmer among the most devout adherents of the Way of Maqet for what they see as abandonment of our old ways. But even they are hard pressed to refute the teachings of the prophet Jaddar now that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has ceded his role as supreme arbiter of doctrine, which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] holds according to the most sacred traditions of the Way of Maqet, to the Herald of Surael.\nThe fact that amongst the Jaddari warriors eager to support our cause are not only elves and humans, but also harpies and even the occasional gnoll remains another point of contention. These Jaddari gnolls have caused quite an uproar at first, their presence distressing to many of our people, but those few amongst us who have spent even a modicum of time with them have been impressed by their apparent newfound devotion to the cause of Surael.\n\nThe port of Dasmatuš is a bustling beehive of activity, as smugglers are loaded with weapons caches destined for resistance cells on the mainland. Our chainbreakers rig their sails, preparing to board as many enemy trading vessels as it takes to bring the despicable slave trade out of Koggraffa to a screeching halt.

"
 zokka_jaddari_war.104.a: "Who can stand against us with Surael and the might of Jaher’s heir aiding our cause!"

 zokka_jaddari_war.105.t: "The Tides are Turning"
 zokka_jaddari_war.105.d: "For centuries, our brave people have fought one desperate battle after the other against the Gnoll hordes which periodically storm out of the vast savanna. Like the sea crushing even the mightiest rock to sand and pebbles over time, wave after wave of these demon-driven invaders have worn down our once mighty forces to the point that a decade ago, we had to evacuate our mainland holdings and seek refuge on the island of Dasmatuš.\n\nBut Surakel has not forsaken us, for when we thought all was lost, he sent a prophet who slew the abominable master of the Gnollish fiends squatting in our lands. Now it is time to turn the tide, once and for all. Like the light of dawn flooding over a world cloaked in darkness, we shall drown our ancestral enemy in their blood and liberate our lands.\n\nAt least, that is what the people on the streets of Dasmatuš tell each other, whether they truly believe it or simply wish it to be true. The title of Akal comes with a solemn duty, however, not to engage in wishful thinking but to clearly assess which course will serve our people best. It all comes down to this - are we truly strong enough to gamble all on the reconquest of our home, or should we let this opportunity pass and hope that there may be an even better one in the future? "
 zokka_jaddari_war.105.a: "The army of Light shall smite the demonic minions defiling the holy land of Dasmazar!"
 zokka_jaddari_war.105.b: "The Dark may seem triumphant, but with the Light in our hearts we pray for better times."

 zokka_jaddari_war.106.t: "The Price of Foolishness"
 zokka_jaddari_war.106.d: "The news trickling in from the north is nothing short of disastrous. Zokka Devourer-of-Suns, our oh-so-glorious lord and master, has in his overweening ambition managed to choke on his latest meal. By challenging the crazed desert prophet of the elves for dominance over the entirety of the eastern Salahad, he bit off more than he could chew. Instead of feasting on another delicious piece of elven meat, his opponent managed to slay him, the blood of the latest would-be Xhazobain draining away into the thirsty desert sand and his feared pack dissolving alongside it.\n\nWhile we certainly won’t shed a single teardrop for the arrogant brute who forced both our sibling packs to kneel, the loss of his protection will surely prove extremely disruptive for our lucrative trade ventures. Thus, when the first confirmed reports of his demise reached the ears of pack mistress [Root.Monarch.GetName], her enraged curses could be heard all over the palace. The slaves were still busy hours later, collecting the last shards of the precious ornamental glass chalices, imported from Rahen, which she threw at any available target in her impotent rage.\n\nAlready, the more diligent overseers and informants amongst our slaves have begun to report rumors making the rounds amongst the enslaved of Zokka’s demise and of an imminent invasion, either by the Maqeti cowering on their island or by Jaddar and his blasted desert lunatics himself. The murmurs are both in [Root.Capital.GetName] and the many slave estates along our realm’s major roads, spreading with every hour like wildfire. If we are not very careful, we may have a major slave revolt or even worse at our hands."
 zokka_jaddari_war.106.a: "This bloody foolish, arrogant wannabe Xhazobain just had to pick a fight he couldn’t win?!"

 zokka_jaddari_war.107.t: "Palaces Built on Quicksand"
 zokka_jaddari_war.107.d: "We have always prided ourselves on our business acumen. There are no flesh merchants more wily or proficient than us in all of Sarhal. However, we are increasingly forced to accept the grim reality that we may have built our gilded palaces on quicksand. Without the threat of Zokka’s bloody retribution safeguarding our independence, our neighbors become bolder in their appetite for our lands with each passing day, and we struggle ever more to keep our enslaved subjects under control.\n\nEven though it goes against everything we hold dear, we may be forced to enter into a losing deal. There are simply no good options left. Either we throw ourselves at the mercy of one of our stronger neighbors or we risk facing an overwhelming invasion and a wide scale slave revolt at the same time, without the required manpower to deal with either threat, let alone both.\n\nAs for whom we should approach with the offer of servitude in exchange for security, the pickings are rather slim. The Maqeti would gladly see each and every member in our pack butchered, and the Jaddari to the north have made their disdain for our cherished institution of slavery more than plain. Approaching Rakkaz and her pack of gibbering fanatics is in practice just a needlessly elaborate and drawn out method of suicide, while Grizaka with her delusions of grandeur would surely accept nothing less than the absolute submission of our pack, turning us into nothing more than another province of her would-be empire.\n\nIn the end, the only option left appears to be Haraagtseda. Even if renouncing the Xhazobkult for a return to the old ways of Kvangahga might anger some of our neighbors to the west, who have been reliably supplying us with fresh meat for our slave traders, paying lip service to the foibles of the holy-smiths might be our only way out of this mess."
 zokka_jaddari_war.107.a: "There is always a way to squirm out of a bad deal, we just haven’t found it yet."
 zokka_jaddari_war.107.b: "Going forth without a protector is utter foolishness - time to beg Haraagtseda for shelter."
 zokka_jaddari_war.107.b_tt: "Should Haraagtseda accept our proposal we will become their vassal and convert to Kvangahga"

 zokka_jaddari_war.108.t: "The Plight of the Slaver Sisters"
 zokka_jaddari_war.108.d: "All signs pointed to it being a tranquil day, perfect for putting in some much needed time at the forge. But whatever new marvel Mazla Haraag [Root.Monarch.GetName] had planned to craft would have to wait, as in the late morning hours an envoy of Khazet, the crafty pack mistress of Koggraffa, arrived at the gates of Kvangraak and requested an audience with the ‘Hammer-of-Kvanga’.\n\nThe topic of this audience turned out to be a quite unique proposal. Khazet offered to turn herself and her pack into our devoted servants, and even appears to be willing to disavow the demonic shamans of the Xhazobkult and turn back to the Way of Kvanga. Our spies have of course long since informed us about the unrest wracking the realms of Maxota’s daughters in the wake of Zokka’s demise, and indeed the renewed fervor for reconquest his fall has awoken in the Maqeti of Dasmatuš. The situation must be more dire than we assumed, though, if greedy cunning Khazet is willing to debase herself in such a manner just for the privilege of crawling under our aegis.\n\nWhile many amongst the master-maker’s trusted advisors suggest we accept her proposal and strengthen our young realm with a new vassal, others are more hesitant. Whether it is the prospect of going to war and spill our blood for the sake of Khazet’s cushy throne, or doubts regarding the sincerity of the submission and conversion on offer, there are vocal opponents to this course, who suggest we should let Khazet suffer the deserved consequences of her greed and bad decisions. "
 zokka_jaddari_war.108.a: "Kvanga teaches us that even the most vile trash can be turned into something worthwhile."
 zokka_jaddari_war.108.b: "Even the Packmother would be hard-pressed to make something worthwhile out of this refuse!"

 zokka_jaddari_war.109.t: "The Bonds of Sisterhood"
 zokka_jaddari_war.109.d: "Ever since Maxota ‘Gifter of Chains’ bore two twin pups, there had been a fierce rivalry between Pack Mistress Zykari and her younger sister Khazet. Whenever one triumphed at a hunt, the other contrived to impress their mother by negotiating a cunning trade deal. When Zykari returned bloodied but victorious after fending off a border raid, it was not long until her rival sibling came up with an ingenious plan to squeeze even more gold from the traders traversing their lands.\n\nBut underneath this fierce rivalry an even more intense sibling bond exists. Nothing unites these two so very divergent sisters so much as someone threatening to come between them. Even when, after the death of their mother, they became rulers in their own right, each sister knew that in the cutthroat world of Gnollish pack politics, having a dependable ally bound by shared blood would prove an invaluable advantage. Each of the sisters possesses unique but complementary gifts, and both know that while alone they are easy prey, together they may fend off any unwanted attention from their neighbours.\n\nBut with her latest maverick plot, Khazet may have strained that sibling bond too far. By denouncing their mother’s legacy and submitting Koggraffa to the sanctimonious blacksmiths of the east, all in a panicked attempt to avoid the consequences of Zokka’s fall, she may have saved her skin for now. But, as many in Zykari’s inner circle whisper, why should Kogzalla bend the knee as well? We have nothing to fear from the Maqeti and their desert patrons, our heartlands have never been claimed by Dasmazar. So why should we follow Khazet’s lead and once more bow and scrape to an overlord who may well turn out to be as useless as Zokka was?"
 zokka_jaddari_war.109.a: "We shared the same womb, we shall not break that bond now!"
 zokka_jaddari_war.109.b: "Even animals know it is foolish to be with the weakest member of the pack once the hunt is on."
 zokka_jaddari_war.109.btt: "Our fate and that of Koggraffa will no longer be linked"

 zokka_jaddari_war.110.t: "Peace for our Time?"
 zokka_jaddari_war.110.d: "It was a promising gamble - accepting the oath of vassalage of Khazet and her pack and the benefits their submission would bring to our pack, in the hopes that our mere presence behind Koggraffa would be enough to deter those Bulwari warmongers. Unfortunately, it appears that we may have misjudged their determination. All signs point to an imminent declaration of war, forcing us to consider whether we are willing to commit to an all-out war in defense of our new vassal or whether it would be more opportune to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.\n\nAfter all, discretion is the better part of valour and we are losing nothing of ours by handing over the lands of the daughters of Maxota. Khazet and her feral sister have not come to us out of a sincere need for repentance, as our courtiers point out, but as opportunists trying to latch onto another patron after their last one turned out to be a bad investment. However, other voices in our council are repulsed by the suggestion and proclaim that keeping our honor is far more valuable than anything we may risk to lose in a war against the northerners. After all, are we not children of Kvanga, who changed us from treacherous demon spirits into beings capable of virtue - should we truly dishonor her work by going back on our word?"
 zokka_jaddari_war.110.a: "Honour may mean nothing to some, but we do not abandon those we swore to protect!"
 zokka_jaddari_war.110.b: "Why should we shed blood for the Maxota's vile daughters? Let the Maqeti have what is theirs!"

 zokka_jaddari_war.111.t: "Calling it Quits?"
 zokka_jaddari_war.111.d: "No matter what bluffs, strategies and diversions we tried, it seems that the noose around our neck is drawing ever closer with each passing month. Not a week passes by without news of a raid on a slave estate, a tax collector being butchered in the countryside, or ever bolder smugglers arming the local rebellious slave population.\n\nWorst of all, it appears that nothing we tried can deter those demon-damned Maqeti from their invasion plans. While a war involving others would normally be a dream come true for any merchant truly devoted to their trade, a war over our very own lands poses an unacceptable risk for all the hard-earned wealth we managed to amass over the last years. Abandoning this profitable enterprise we have managed to establish may be painful, but a prudent merchant knows when to cut their losses. Can we truly risk all the riches we have acquired on the uncertain chance that we may repel those sanctimonious islanders? Or should we call it quits and offer a peaceful surrender in return for safe passage for our court, the contents of our treasury and our entourage of slaves? With all our riches we can start our own slave-trading venture somewhere far from these shores, or retire and live in luxury until the end of our days."
 zokka_jaddari_war.111.a: "Ah, blast it - it may be time to retire. I hear Vandipha is lovely this time of the year!"

 zokka_jaddari_war.112.d: "Despite their stubborn resistance and treacherous tactics, our Gnollish adversaries could only delay the inevitable - stopping the preordained outcome of this holy war was clearly never within their means. At this point in the war, no one could doubt that we and our faithful Jaddari allies are poised to overwhelm their lines in the near future. Even the most delusional warmongers on the opposing side are coming to terms with this fact.\n\nThus it comes as no surprise that they have approached us under a flag of truce and finally offered to give us what was rightfully ours in the first place, lest we take even more from them. While there are voices amongst our war council that urge the Akal to press our advantage and end Gnollish rule over the eastern savanna once and for all, more prudent voices warn against overextending ourselves. Winning the war is one thing, they advise, but winning the peace that follows will be much more challenging - something the Akal reluctantly agrees with.\n\nBefore we can turn our minds to breaking the Gnollish yoke over the heartlands of Sarhal, we first need to restore firm control over our former lands and cleanse them of the taint left by Maxota’s vile spawn and their sycophantic slavers. For now, we shall accept their pleas for peace. Only once we have secured the home of our people and built up our forces can we start looking outwards again. Then we shall bring the word of Surakel to the chained masses kept in bondage in the Dark-tainted lands of Sarhal!"

Just as Jaddar’s grandfather did centuries ago, we shall sweep away all resistance and lift the gnollish yoke from the people of Dasmazar, together securing the shore of the Maqeti Coast for the faithful once more."

That said, it must have happened at some point in the past few decades, for that is the only possibly provenance of today's shocking scene in [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\nThe treasury was undergoing a careful inventory, when suddenly it rang with a series of loud explosions. Apparently, one of the guards had put his tea down on a dusty mahogany table that languished amidst other never-used gifts — and that act must have triggered some long-forgotten contingency spell. The table was instantly transmuted into a collection of spell tablets, which date at least to the Age of God-Kings.\n\nThe mage guild is clamoring for access to these, saying it will revolutionize their craft. But the guard claims to have been imbued with some of the same magic that revealed them, and as long as we are willing to provide him with copious tea, he will be able to master their knowledge in a way none other could.

The szal-Mehran, a reputed Mašnsih tribe living in the midst of the desert, established a prosperous trade route along the ruthless Salahad. Using strategic locations such as the port city of Edešukuru, their homelands in Shimlardu, and the safety of the walls of Azka-sur, these Mašnsih prospered as guides for the trade caravans who preferred to brave the Salahad.\n\nWith our newfound control over these key cities, the Szal-Mehran are finding more and more willing customers who relish the opportunity to travel through a route under the jurisdiction of a single country, no longer fearing that patrols from differing states may impose a new tariff on their goods.

The learned men do emphasize that there must be a good reason to protect this place if the whole of the Sihrušam completely support any and all actions of the szal-Ardeth.\n\nThe skeptical in our court were quick to denounce the words of these wise men as silly fairy tales and ask [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to stand against the tribals who threaten the people of [Root.Country.GetName]."

It seems they have harbored human mages who sought exile from the Empire to pursue arcane knowledge, going against the law of the Phoenix. They have developed their magical capabilities beyond the levels considered safe for the human mind. It seems there is a prominent reason as to why the mages gather here, and also as to how they were able to develop their skills so greatly in the middle of a desert: The artifacts and treasures that Ulmišbar provides them, they are imbued with knowledge of ancient Bulwar.\n\nOur armed men and archeologists have been retrieving these artifacts as the humans struggled to hide them to no avail.

At a certain point, each member seems to spin a different tale, but all agree on the fact that the earth shook and an ominous, earpiercing roar was heard far in the distance.\n\nOur brave explorers say that they swiftly fled from the rooms they excavated and found themselves amidst a huge sandstorm, some say that they saw the shadow of a gigantic creature moving among the sands. After gathering as many artifacts as they could, the crew fled from Ulmišbar along with the panicked szal-Fazil. They heard a final bellow and the earth shook once more and when they looked back, the silhouette of Ulmišbar was gone, buried once more into the depths of the Salahad.\n\nThe crestfallen szal-Fazil tribe accompanied the expedition until they reached Saranza, their settlement which was once only used as a place to meet foreigners, now their permanent home, and stopped there while our party went on its way with the artifacts they took."

 bulwar_flavour.51.d:0 "Tell [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]; Your servant Veharia Faranzuir sends the following message:\n\nI am writing this letter regarding an accident that occurred while I was traveling through the hills between Aqatbar and Eduz-Wez. It concerns the cult known as the Five Thousand. Let me talk about them, as I have recently contacted some of them and started to understand the peculiarities of their faith: Followers of the Five Thousand do not merely pray or rest in contemplation - they act. They spend every spare hour of every day since infancy with training. When reaching adulthood, they seek to emulate the warrior-heroes of old and their selfless service; as such, they seek to protect the innocent and fight against evil; be it wild beasts, monsters, or those who dare to harm the weak.\n\nI managed to experience them in action when they protected the trader caravan I travelled with through the hinterlands of Bahar from a bandit attack, even though they did not seek nor receive a reward for their deed. Afterwards, while I accompanied them, I learned further details about the Five Thousand - they constantly roam in small groups across the countryside and believe unity is the true way to stand against the dark. They fight and train to confront the world's current evils, taking a firm stand in emulation of their heroes.\n\nI sent you this missive because I am convinced they would be a great boon to our kingdom."

 bulwar_flavour.52.d:0 "Tell Cecilio: Your friend Fardante sends the following message:\n\nAs part of my latest research on Bulwari religious practices, I have been intensely researching a particular cult: The Cult of Aphorisms. After leaving the House of Wisdom of Crathanó, I travelled to the Gelkar lands, where I first encountered adherents of the Cult of the Aphorists.\nTo be considered a true member, the candidate does not necessarily need to memorise all the Bulwari Classics or all the aphorisms that have been assembled by the cult. They instead need to craft a novel aphorism out of religious scripture or rediscover a forgotten one. As such, most who follow the Cult are considered followers, not actual members. It takes years of studying the scriptural classics of the Dinu Sar and digging through thousands of ancillary theological works to find a piece of wisdom unknown to the current members. Still, the number of candidates is always high each year, as being considered an Aphorist is an honor among Gelkar society. At one of their gatherings, I even heard one aphorism that reminded me of you: “If a scribe knows only a single line but his handwriting is good, he is indeed a scribe!” Do you recall that when we started our studies, you could copy everything but only knew how to write your name."

Our spies are convinced those messages must have come from the Cult of the Eclipse, a radical group that believes in cleansing Bulwar from crime and what they consider the stain of the monstrous races.\n\nOne of the letters we received contained the names of all those considered “sympathizers” of gnolls, harpies, or goblins, be they individuals who trade with them or have any other form of relationship with them. We can of course ignore those parts and focus only on the useful sections about criminal activity within our borders. This cult appears very experienced in acquiring, cataloguing and investigating evidence of what they consider crimes in the eyes of Surakel. A clandestine cooperation with the cult could be a boon for our nation, but they have very radical positions that can disagree with some groups.\n\n"

The city may lie in ruins, but they still keep the Red Flame alive in the crumbled temple.\n\nA gnoll priest of the temple gave us a message, saying they are one of the few Red Flames remaining and that they used to burn the remains of the Red Xhaz, defeated by Jaher. They believe that as long as the flame remains, no Xhaz, Xhazobine, or Xhazobain will threaten Bulwar ever again. The scouts have noticed that all the priests and attendants wear armor beneath their garments and swords at their sides; they also appear to have fought on numerous occasions, as many are covered in scars, and some even wear bandages and various prostheses.\n\nThey are remnants and veterans of a thousand battles against the Xhazob Gnolls; could they be the remains of the so-called Guardians of Gold? The elite guard of the Suncrown Gnolls? At the moment, they refuse to be called anything other than ‘Marzana's heirs’.

They have a strange custom, different from all the other cults, that, according to them, was introduced to their lands by former slaves hailing from the land of Kui. They prepare a beautiful effigy over the course of an entire year; beautiful depictions of their kings and queens are usual, but it is not uncommon for Surakel and Maqet to also appear. They adorn the effigy with great care, affixing many jewels and trinkets, painting it, or sculpting it to further enhance its majesty. They also prepare a gigantic banquet featuring diverse, luxurious dishes.\n\nEvery year, the adherents all gather on the public square of their town, with the effigy in the middle. According to one of the priests I spoke to, the ceremony begins with chains being broken to symbolize the end of slavery. Then, they burn the effigy together with samplings of the foods prepared, and celebrate and feast around it while it burns. This celebration continues for the entire night, only stopping when the sun appears on the horizon. According to the priesthood, the burning is required to send the nourishing feast to Surael and to honor Maqet.\n\nGaining the support of such a diverse group of people would be beneficial if we intend to oppose oppression and unjust rulers.

I decided to take the old Edešukeru route to Rahen instead of the Golden Highway, because I assumed it would be quicker and more profitable. How wrong I was.\n\nI lost my entire expedition, including supplies and water, in the desert in just a week. I was alone, wandering through the dunes, already preparing to die, when I was saved. They called themselves the Cult of the Sand-Grandfather; they believe a Dragon is their great protector. It's weird, I know. It is funny that they cared for me despite being a useless mouth to them, with no coin or name to protect me.\n\nThey gave me water, fed me until my strength returned, and carried me to an outpost. When I said I had no way to get back home because I had lost all my possessions, they gave me a small pouch of incense to sell so I could return. According to them, I was a guest; a guest for them is sacred and must be treated as family. I had no idea people like those still existed.

A storm struck my ship, and I was left to drift around the endless sea until a group of fishermen saved me. I soon learned that they all belong to a cult followed by many of the sailors and fishermen along the Divenhal Coast. They believe that their so-called Sea-Ancestors have been elevated by Surakel to the rank of what the rest of the Sun Cult calls Chosen, and that they will protect their followers at sea.\n\nThey took me back to the coast, where I lived with them until I recovered from my ordeal. Their lives are focused on the sea and they are consequently very knowledgeable about it. They always knew when a storm would hit and where to catch the biggest fish. They know many tricks and methods to mitigate the worst tempers of the waters and make the vast sea look like a small lake. There is a custom of theirs that I have found described in records from all around the Bulwar coast: they put an effigy of the one they want to protect close to the sea with some offerings. If, on the next day, it is gone, it means the sea has accepted it. The Sea-Ancestors will now protect the person represented by the effigy.\n\nI believe reinforcing our ties with this Cult can only strengthen our position on the seas."

They are followers of the Cerulean Mother; as they knew I was involved in the investigation they invited me to their meeting. They wanted to come ‘clean’ and present a defense for their acts.\n\nThey discussed their desire to expand research on magic and arcane knowledge in our country. Still, because the local temples are hardline followers of the Jexisian Regulations, they have remained hidden until now. They show me their projects and books; none of what I saw seems to be what we could consider forbidden Binding magic or the Evil Eye. If anything, their spells look like the Light spells our Exorcist-priest uses, but the way the spells operate feels familiar yet foreign, as they probably are related to the practices of old Dameria.\n\nTheir knowledge is vast, and they have shown an incredible talent for understanding and casting magic, so an alliance with them would be a boon to our kingdom if we are to expand our magic infrastructure and research."

Thanks to a recent discovery, I must rewrite a significant part of my thesis. I found a proper translator for Panušesi, and not just that, but I have made contact with a whole sect that preserves the old rituals and antiquated language used during the past ages of Bulwar.\n\nThey are called the Cult of the Dyad for their firm belief that only the Kings Aga and Barid have been Surakel Reborn. They are adhering to the teachings codified during the Universal Council of Sardazar of 351, the first Universal Council of the Sun Cult, untouched by later translations or additional commentaries. Observing their practices is like watching a living fossil; we now can decipher hundreds of writings and records of practices that were previously locked behind our inability to understand Panušesi, which went extinct during the time of the Petty Kingdoms. Also, we can trace how several practices have changed through the years by comparing them with the rites practised by this unique cult.\n\nI request emergency attention to this matter."

A creamy, slightly moist, rindless cheese, it is aged for no more than six months. According to legend, this unique cheese was created when Ukdan Manad, a poor shepherd, was smitten by a harpy journeying past the cave he rested in. Abandoning his meager lunch of ewe's milk cheese and stale bread, he ran to try and catch her. When he returned dejected some weeks later, he saw distinctive veins of blue mold throughout his forgotten lunch - these veins of the same color as lapis are the pride of Lawaššar and its many imitators today, imparting a strong tanginess and fragrance with a short maturation time of only a few weeks.\n\nWe could invest in Lawaššar to increase the production, and make the world know the virtues of its cheese."

This merchant family, formerly known as the Cheese Kings, made their fortune by importing and selling cheese from all the corners of Surakeš in the city. There was a time that their influence was greater than even some of the Twelve Families, but now they are a shadow of their former glory; they are dedicated to small commercial operations, and more often, to scams.\n\nToday, a Surani merchant by the name of Nanni approached [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], calling for justice. It seems that he bought Eskuz, a Kuzarami cheese said to be the color of purest white and sporting holes artificially created to better represent Kuza, from one of the EaNasir.

 bulwar_flavour.117.d:0 "One of the oldest cheeses of Bulwar, and a favorite of the merchants that roam the Golden Highway, the Betfaziya is a variety of white cheese, made with milk from sheep or goats. Currently most Betfaziya belong to the naqta Betfaziya variant, which after a first maturation period is reduced into tiny bits by passing it through a mincing machine, then subjected to a second and third maturation period, for a total of 3 months. After this, the cheese is ready to be enjoyed by the Surani and their friends in Seghdihr.\n\nAn old text from the time of the Djinn Sultanates, attributed to a cheese master known as Adhriya, has been found in the libraries of Eduz-Vacyn, containing the oldest recipe of Betfaziya known to date. The recipe details the creation of what we know as brined betfaziya, a strong cheese of fast creation that after 4-5 days is ready for consumption. However, the recipe is accompanied by incantations to keep demons away from the cheese. Some scholars believe that the incantation enhances the cheese, while others believe that is a curse. One of the scholars made the cheese, but no one is brave enough to eat it."

 bulwar_flavour.120.d:0 "The sky bleeds.\n\nWord spreads throughout the many towns and cities of Bulwar, brought ashore by merchants, travelers, and soldiers returning from the frontlines. The Namensar, upon hearing of the event, are quick to proclaim it to be the work of the Malevolent Dark. They demand that we march north, to Cannor, in order to combat its growing influence.\n\nAs speculation over the matter grows, the scholars of Bulwar are quick to gather, and just as quick to become divided over whether it is a natural or magical phenomenon. Their discussions are fervent as they mutter a thousand and one possible explanations as to why the sky of Cannor bleeds. Yet their words amount to little, as not a single one of them has provided evidence to support their dubious claims.\n\nRegardless of the truth, we cannot deny what our eyes see: and neither can the Cannorians. They seem to take it as a sign of the struggle between their pantheon, as their gods wage war against one another. With both the land and heavens of Cannor dyed red, their priests have taken to calling this event the Crimson Deluge. The whole continent boils with anger; the nations of Cannor begin to gather their armies. War seems inevitable.\n\nWith our recent forays into Cannor proving greatly successful, our advisors are confident that we can take advantage of this chaos. More than ever, Cannor lies weak and divided, ready to be brought under our righteous rule."

 bulwar_flavour.121.d:0 "Day after day, Surael stands watch over mankind. All beneath his light feel his warmth, and all who dare gaze upon him are blinded by his radiance. He is a god, the only living god, and he stands alone against the Malevolent Dark.\n\nBut even a god can falter.\n\nKuza, Goddess of the Moon, was Surael’s mother. And, like all other gods, she perished. Despite her death, however, the moon still lingers. Her light is lesser than it once was, but it remains a constant and painful reminder of what had once been. Each and every day Surael flees upon her approach, wandering beyond the horizon and only returning to his garden once she has passed.\n\nSometimes, he is not quick enough. Sometimes, Surael comes face to face with his greatest failure. Sometimes, Surael gazes upon the moon, and Surael mourns.\n\nIn those rare days we call Eclipses, it is said that darkness covers Bulwar. As Surael falters, his faithful must light the world in his stead. Each and every man in Bulwar is obliged to light a flame, whether that be a candle or a large pyre, in mourning. In mourning for their god’s loss. For any loved ones who have succumbed to the Malevolent Dark.\n\nHundreds of thousands (if not millions) of fires, large and small, are said to be clearly seen from high above in the sky. From where Surael struggles, these lights remind him that he is not yet truly alone – and that he will never be alone for as long as his faithful draw breath. Surael, once again, is drawn out of his mourning.\n\nAs Kuza and Surael draw near to each other, preparations are made all across Bulwar. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is expected to light the largest of all flames."

 bulwar_flavour.125.d:0 "The Bloomsdawn Equinox is well-known in Bulwar as the beginning of spring, when days grow longer than nights and Surael begins to rise to the height of his power. Known as the Umašaru, the Day of the Lion, the Bloomsdawn Equinox has been celebrated by the peoples of Bulwar for generations, although the City of Kalib has always boisterously claimed to be the origin and namesake of the tradition.\n\nOpposite the Umaslu, which calls for moderation of one’s behavior and strict adherence to all of the Sun Cult’s teachings, the Umašaru is believed to be a short reprieve from one’s duties and responsibilities. As Surael grows in power once again, he weakens the influence of the Malevolent Dark upon the world – enough so for some merriment and relaxation to be found. During a single day each year, the faithful are encouraged to enjoy themselves to the fullest, and to spend the day in revelry not only with family, neighbors, and close companions, but also with distant relatives, acquaintances, travelers, and strangers.\n\nAlthough celebrated in most cities and towns of Bulwar, the event has never truly been acknowledged and officialized by the Namensar, who consider it to be nothing more than an excuse for debauchery and lapses in one’s faith. They thus favor far more diligent and respectful celebrations.\n\nSome of our advisors say there is no need for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take a stance on the matter, but our support of such a cherished tradition would undoubtedly bolster its popularity even further."

It is majestic, radiant, and beautiful in equal measure.\n\nPushed by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors and confidantes, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] heading towards Brasan. Thousands join the hasty procession, and, after many days, the march finally arrives upon the Port of Emperors: only to find it already-crowded with pilgrims.\n\nPerched upon the walls of the City, the sun at its back, the proud and unfettered Sun’s Herald looms over all. It listens to the words of the common man, noble, and priest alike. It advises and it teaches, and its words ring clearly and without error. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] joins the long line that goes from one street of Brasan to the other, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] quietly awaits [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] turn to be granted audience.\n\nWhen the time finally comes for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to stand before it, the Sarnagir does not speak. It merely gazes down upon the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], its eyes burning, its form flickering like flames, too painful to gaze upon for long. After what feels like hours of silence, as all breathlessly await, a feather is gently battered by the wind. It drifts, its course seeming uncertain, only for it to come to a rest upon the cupped hands of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Sun’s Herald inclines its head. In its gleaming, fiery eyes, only one thing remains: approval.\n\nWeeks after it has departed, word continues to spread.

With their funding assigned on a yearly basis, exemplars often hire a magistrate or merchant to bargain with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in their name.\n\nThe time has once again come for such a meeting to take place: and, after thorough discussions, an amount is decided upon. It is a considerable sum, but not an unreasonable one. It is expected that we grant them their funding as soon as possible.\n\nWe could do so... or we could convince the Namensar, a force with considerable influence amongst the Exemplars, to pay them in our stead.

Although most are content to merely focus their efforts upon their chosen profession, there are a few who go even further, dedicating their entire lifespans to collecting the world’s bounty. Known by some as sages, by others as scholars, and by a few as fools, these elves wander from one place to another, never staying still for long.\n\nOne such elf has found his way to our court. Having offered a generous amount of coin to peruse our library, he has scarcely interacted with other courtiers and visitors. That changed, however, when he met our heir. The two have begun to often engage in conversation with each other, and it almost appears as though the elf has taken a new student under his wing. Events have developed to such a point that he has even come before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the rest of the court, officially offering his temporary services as a tutor. His motivation, when questioned, appears to be as much a willingness to see our heir’s education furthered as it is to see his duty as one of the Chosen fulfilled by sharing his knowledge with another.\n\nAlthough learning from such a scholar could prove beneficial for our heir, the Namensar were quick to pronounce their objection to the idea. They argue that the elf’s intentions are not to be trusted, and that he could potentially seek to subvert our heir’s adherence to the Old Sun Cult’s teachings in favor of his own."

The first cohort of human mages trained there has finished their apprenticeship and will soon be ready to use their arcane gift in service of our realm and for the glory of Surael, requiring a lavish ceremony to commemorate the occasion.\n\nAfter the official part of the ceremony was over, [Root.Monarch.GetName] joined the lavish feast held in honor of the alumni and the esteemed guests, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] first among them. At one point a sorceress with an ethereal beauty accentuated by eyes the color of the midday sky caught the eye of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Introducing herself as Nehša, she engaged our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in a discussion about the lost heights of magical knowledge reached by the Magušimi of old, demonstrating a profound level of erudition. Given [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fascination for this remarkable sorceress, no one was surprised when she joined the retinue on the journey back to the palace.\n\nIn the following weeks, she attended [Root.Monarch.GetName] on several occasions, discussing such complex topics as the ascension of the God-kings, the virtues of magocratic rule, and the tale of the Serpent-king Hašahu, the most powerful mage in the last two millennia of Bulwari history. Hinting at the continued existence of a covert cabal of his acolytes, she suggested establishing an accord of sorts with these custodians of occult mysteries to regain the heights of magical prowess achieved by ancient Bulwar."

 bulwar_flavour.139.d:0 "In the Sareyand-Jaddari war, Aldarian fought not in grand battles but as a mercenary along the margins - scouting, raiding, clashing with enemies in dust and heat. But it was during one of those missions that he earned a name worth remembering.\n\nOne afternoon, while Aldarian led his men along the dusty roads near the advancing Jaddari, fate intervened. A vanguard emerged - their commander felled in a brief, brutal clash. Amid the chaos, Aldarian took command and dispatched a rider to a nearby scouting party with urgent orders. As they began to return, Aldarian seized the moment. He ordered a feigned retreat, drawing the Jaddari forward. Just as the enemy overcommitted, the flanking force struck - shattering their momentum and sending them into a full rout.\n\nWord of Aldarian’s leadership spread quickly through the ranks. Yet as the war wore on, an uncertainty began to take root in his mind. Amid the clamor of battle, the unshakable faith demonstrated by the Desert Legion suggested a possibility he could no longer ignore - perhaps his own convictions were in error, and Jaddar had truly been granted a revelation by Surael Himself. This doubt grew steadily, urging him to question his past and consider a path illuminated by a higher, radiant calling.\n\nAfter the conflict ended, restless and seeking something beyond mere survival, he led his men into the desert in search of fortune and lost relics. In the solitude of the sands, he found not just adventure, but faith. The words of Jaddari warriors echoed in his mind, and as the years passed, he embraced the very belief he had once fought against.\nHe returned from the sands with a new light in his eyes, a tempered faith, and a diminished but devoted band of loyal warriors.\n\nNow, kneeling before [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName], Aldarian speaks with quiet resolve: \"We’ve fought in deserts and thrived where others would have perished.

He arranged his forces to mask their true strength on the flanks, intentionally displaying a hint of vulnerability. Slowly, he baited the Varamhari into pressing forward along those exposed edges.\n\nIn the heat of the engagement, as the enemy’s cavalry swept in to exploit this ostensible weakness, Aldarian held his ground. Then, with precise timing, he ordered a focused, rapid advance into the heart of the enemy formation. This decisive thrust exploited the gap created by the overzealous push of the Varamhari, shattering their center and unraveling their battle discipline. The shock of the breach sent panic through their ranks, and the once-proud host crumbled into disarray and retreated.\n\nEvery maneuver, every calculated order, further contributed to the legend of the Sunspear growing with each passing battle.\"\n\n - Oloris Karzonzuir, The Legend of Surpašilu, 1479"

From that day forward, he was not just a soldier; he was the Sunspear, Surpašilu, a leader whispered of in campfires and war councils alike.\n\nBut even then, something stirred within him. Amid cries of battle and encountering the fierce conviction of the Desert Legion, Aldarian saw a strength beyond mere discipline - a faith that did not waver, even in defeat. Jaddar’s followers fought not just with steel, but with certainty. That certainty began to gnaw at Aldarian, quietly at first, then steadily louder.\n\nAfter the conflict, restless and seeking something beyond mere survival, he led his men into the desert in search of fortune and lost relics. In the solitude of the sands, he found not just adventure, but faith.\n\nHe did not convert in haste. Years passed, and with them, comrades fell to time and hardship. Yet the few who remained saw the change in him - not as weakness, but as a quiet strength. The spear once raised against the faithful now rested in reverence.\n\nHe returned from the sands with a new light in his eyes, a tempered faith, and a dwindled band of loyal warriors. He offered his services to Sareyand, raised the standard and took command.\n\nAnd now, as war looms once more, Aldarian refuses to raise his spear against the Herald of Surael. The faith he had found in the desert was stronger than any oath he had sworn before. He has cast aside his old banners and come before Jaddar - not as a captive, nor a traitor, but as a penitent. In his eyes is not guilt, but purpose.\n\nAs Jaddar gazes upon him, he does not see a deserter. He sees a man reforged in the fires of doubt and faith alike. To reject him would be to deny the very grace that calls the lost home. "

With the inexorable changes coming towards all of Surakeš and beyond in the wake of Jaddar’s revelations, the high Kašra of Eduz-Rakadagš has shown the wisdom to once more obey the patently obvious will of Surael and joyfully embrace this latest dawn, just as his predecessor did during the time of the Sunrise War. Instead of mourning the sun setting over the theological reforms espoused by Taelarios Irrliamzuir and canonized at the council of Brasan, the greatest of all Suraelic temples has chosen to walk with the people along the Way of Jaddar, the latest and greatest prophet of Surael.

Inspired by this unanimous display of faith, a plethora of minor temples both within and beyond our borders have followed their example and espoused the tenets of the Jadd.\n\nJust as the first rays of dawn after a cold desert night thaw the face of a weary traveller, just as the first drop of spring water soothes the parched lips of a desert nomad after a long journey, it has been a balm on the souls of all adherents of the Jadd to see these mighty and venerable temples endorse the teachings of Jaddar. In the aftermath, many of our subjects who were hesitant to abandon their old beliefs have shed their doubts and joined us in the valiant struggle against the Dark.\n\nAll across Surakeš, this proclamation has shaken the status quo. Our friends and allies are emboldened, our enemies and rivals dismayed. Many within Surael’s Garden have openly started to question whether the Sun Elves are truly the only Chosen of Surael, or whether they, too, could be chosen by Him to serve His Will.\n\nNow is the time to spread Surael’s Will far and wide! Now is the time to bring all the children of Surael into the fold! Together we shall bring the fight to the Malevolent Dark and its depraved servants all over Halann!"

This man was stranded upon a desolate foreign shore with no hope of ever returning to his former home. Rising from the stony beach were rocky cliffs, stretching onwards in every direction he looked, cloaked in a dusky gloom.\nBut gleaming behind the lip of the cliff face was a faint glow, beckoning the man. He gathered his remaining strength and started to climb. After what seemed like an eternity he reached the top of the cliff, only to be greeted by the sight of steep rocks rising onwards and onwards from the shore, all merely the foothills of a truly gargantuan mountain whose outline could only barely be guessed at by the hazy glow emanating from behind it.\nUndaunted by the task he had set himself, he started to climb towards the mountain, filled with an unshakable certainty that he needed to see the source of the distant light brightening the eternal twilight. Slowly he made his way onward and upward towards his goal, resting only when he must, until he reached a massive chasm preventing his advance. But he never wavered in his convictions, fashioning crude tools from what his meagre surroundings offered him, and finally managed to build a shaky bridge across the chasm. On the other side the mountain rose to further heights. Steep cliffs, treacherous rockslides and freezing cold conspired to keep the man from his goal, but he vanquished them one after the other.\nPresently he was no longer alone, joined by others on the path he had cleared. Those with a certain gleam in their eyes, he bade to accompany him on his journey, as he recognized in them his own desire to lay eyes on what was hidden beyond the mountain. For years and years they struggled onwards, until finally the man climbed the last stretch of a crag and dragged himself onto a barren plateau that was bathed in glorious golden sunlight. Exhausted beyond measure, the man closed his eyes and enjoyed the warmth of the sun after untold years spent in the cold twilight, assured that he had reached his goal at last. Little did he notice that he had only ascended a lesser peak of the mountain, whose true apex rose in the cloudy distance.’\n\n‘This man,’ Jaddar spoke to his rapturous audience of young temple acolytes, ‘was Taelarios Irrliamzuir. Should he be remembered as a fool who failed to realize that there were further peaks to climb? That what he had reached over a lifetime of devotion was merely a waystation, not the end of the road?’\n‘Certainly not! For while Taelarios might not have grasped the entirety of Surael’s Will, the true enormity of His Love for all sentient beings, he guided untold others along a steep and treacherous path out of the Darkness and towards the Light! And with his death, we all are bereft of a devoted teacher, diminished without his wisdom.’"

Even those who used to scoff at Jaddar’s claim to belong to Jaher’s august lineage were forced to admit that he has indeed proven himself the true heir of Jexis.\nYet the Jadd Empire is not the only empire claiming to be the successor to the Phoenix Empire. Far to the west, on the shores of the Dameshead Sea, lies the Empire of Anbennar, which formed out of the ashes of the westernmost territories of the Phoenix Empire. \nNow with Brasan firmly under imperial control - the premier link between Bulwar and Cannor - a proposal has been laid before the throne of the Divine-Herald to send forth an imperial emissary to the Anbennarian imperial court in Anbenncóst. \nThe more bellicose members of the court consider the primary objective of such an emissary the official proclamation of Jaddar as the heir of Jexis and thus the Jadd Empire as the sole legitimate successor to the Phoenix Empire, denouncing any other rival claims. The mercantile faction, on the other hand, is far more intrigued by the lucrative trading opportunities that might open up if a mutual treaty of recognition and amity could be negotiated. \nThe ultimate goal of such a mission might be contentious amongst the court’s factions, but surprisingly, almost all participants in this debate are united behind the person of the potential emissary. Dariaš, a scion of the szal-Jaddar line of Jaddar’s descendants, has garnered a reputation as an accomplished diplomat, and his blood ties to Jexis through Jaddar have made him an obvious candidate, especially given the Cannorian obsession with Half-elves, as they call the Mišari.\nHowever, the final decision whether to invest in such an endeavour ultimately lies with the Divine-Herald himself."

But instead of dockhands beginning to unload the cargo, a large ramp was lowered from the deck. What emerged from the vessel's hold was something that even the cosmopolitan cóstine populace could later only describe as the spectacle of a lifetime. Dancers and acrobats, humans and elves and even harpies, clad in the finest diaphanous Bulwari and Raheni silks, streamed onto the docks, followed by musicians playing all manner of exotic instruments. An imposing looking honor guard of gnolls and Harimari tigermen followed, until finally six centaurs, carrying an ornate palanquin, brought up the rear. \nThe procession slowly wound its way through the main thoroughfares of the city towards the Imperial Palace, while coins and precious gifts were freely handed out to the spectators.\nAt the palace gates, proper credentials were presented, and in short order the palanquin and its inner retinue was swiftly escorted to the audience hall. There [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was engrossed in debate with the great lords and ladies of the Empire.\nThe din filling the hall swiftly subsided with this unexpected arrival, and the nobility of the empire made room for the palanquin to be lowered in front of the imperial throne. As soon as it touched the ground, its silken curtains parted. An imposing half-elf clad in lavish silk robes and a gem-studded turban emerged, bowing deeply before the imperial throne.\nWith a sonorous voice, he addressed the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]: “I stand before you as a humble servant and emissary of the Herald of Surael, the Divine-Herald and Phoenix-Emperor Jaddar Jexiszuir, Lord and Master of all the lands of Bulwar, Rahen and beyond. I am here to announce that the Phoenix has risen once again from the ashes to bring Surael’s Light to the world. \nMy Most Exalted Lord is extending the hand of friendship and brotherly love to you and all your noble subjects, who have honored the legacy of his most noble mother by maintaining the divinely ordained Order in these western lands.

Our Šabari and Barkabti merchant-nobles are already giddy with anticipation at the thought of those lucrative new mercantile opportunities."

Their arrogant refusal has made it clear that in due time, these lost westernmost holdings of the Phoenix Empire need to be returned to the fold and their lords forced to prostrate themselves before the most exalted throne of the Divine-Herald.\nThe imperial court, the nobility, the priesthood and even the faithful common people agree that this proves without a doubt that only by uniting the many realms and peoples of Halann under the banner of the Jadd Empire can Surael be served and the Struggle against the Dark be won. Relying on the wisdom and grace of foreign rulers, who may well be hopelessly tainted by the influence of the Malevolent Dark, is clearly a fool’s errant!"

Therefore, ever since their first appearance their discovery is traditionally interpreted to be a sign of Surael’s approval, whether for finder, city or ruler.

It was his delusional attempt to restore his hold over Baharkand and rule all of eastern Bahar, just as his ancestress Amarien once did, that truly began the Decades of Devastation, bringing misery and death to untold Bahari. \nHe filled his court with sycophants and pompous fools, while all who demonstrated a modicum of honor and competence were chased away due to his increasing paranoia. The breaking point was finally reached when he alienated his most successful general Dartaxes szel-Farramaz for the last time, thus inciting the Great Rebellion that saw the birth of Dartaxâgerdim. \nEven the last vestiges of filial piety within Keladora could not deter her from doing what was needed, and she launched a coup against her father to save her realm. For the last three decades he has spent his existence under house arrest in a remote monastery deep within the Šad Kuz, swiftly forgotten by all but his most ardent enemies and a few scholars. Meanwhile, his daughter has worked tirelessly to expunge the stain her father’s inept rule left on the family name of the Birzartanzuir and return Birzartanšes onto the path to greatness.\nNow, the abbot of the monastery has sent a secret missive to court, informing Keladora of her father’s passing. A most difficult decision now lies before her. Should a proper state funeral be held, which might risk reminding nobility and common people alike of the many failings of their former monarch, endangering her efforts to distance herself from his reign?

On the fourth side the temple ziggurat of Eduz-Baghalwa, the Temple of the Blessed Gate, rises up, and beyond it the temple garden terraces descend to the banks of the Keygas. \nThe entire complex, called Mekrebdarek by the local Ofehibi, has quickly become a cherished institution in the metropolis at the mouth of the Keygas after the introduction of the Sun Cult to these lands. Whether dispensing alms to the poor, providing solace to the faithful, or sheltering travelling pilgrims, the temple is one of the pillars of the city, and during the high religious festivals the processional avenue is crowded by Dakmenderi citizens and pilgrims from all across the Ofehibi coast and the lower Keygas basin.\nAside from catering to the spiritual needs of the Dakmenderi, one of the main functions of the temple and its associated hostelries is the accommodation of pilgrims hailing from all across eastern Sarhal on their way to the holy sites of Bulwar. As for many amongst their number, the city is the last stop on their journey before they sail across the Gulf of Rahen towards Surael’s Garden. "

Just as the Thirteen Days of Darkness might have meant the end of the old Bulwari Pantheon, Surael’s rebirth ushered in the glorious new dawn of a radiant age of Light.\nHis rebirth is therefore the focus of celebrations in the aptly named Temple of Sacred Rebirth, the Eduz-Qašdulittaru - or Gekwepizaa, as the local Kombedak Dakinshi and Cyazizeta lizardfolk prefer to call it. \nWhile Kuvunika might not experience much in the way of seasonal variation, the ancient Bulwari calendar is still used to determine the date of the winter solstice. On this date, an enormous celebration of Surael Reborn transforms the city. \nA massive procession begins at dawn, travelling from the eastern city gate to the innermost circle of the spire fortress and the temple ziggurat found on the southern side of the shattered spire. Here, from midday onwards all through the remaining day and the night that follows, ceremonies praising Surael and exhorting him in his Struggle are held. All throughout the city, the people are gathered either in solemn vigil or in raucous celebration of Surael’s impending rebirth.

The Ashhana lizardfolk in particular have become the most fervent adherents of Szurral, seeing His Struggle against the Malevolent Dark reflected in their own inner struggle against their violent impulses.

Even if Elikhet himself has been lost to the machinations of the Malevolent Dark, by his actions he was defending Surael’s Order against the forces of darkness.\nIt is little wonder then, that just as Kuza is still remembered and her deeds praised high up in the mountains of the Šad Kuz, that the memory of Elikhet still has a place in the hearts of the people of Kheterat. It is in the Qaar-Inimahat, the Temple of the Bringer of Order, that the priests remind the people that everyone, be they resplendent god or mere mortal, has a duty to do their part in the defense of the divinely ordained order of the world.\nThis concept is echoed in the very design of the temple itself, with a series of grandiose halls and austere buildings arranged in a symmetrical layout around the central courtyard and the temple pyramid of Eduz-Biblahmu within. Filling the halls and processional avenues of the temple complex at every hour are throngs of pilgrims seeking to affirm their faith receive guidance from the assembled priesthood."

 bulwar_flavour.318.d:0 "The city of Yetmesira has undergone a truly profound transformation ever since its inhabitants joined the ranks of the faithful followers of the Sun Cult - the Sar-Arukanaš or Devotion to the Light. What was once a city of gilded cruelty, its wealth built on the shattered hopes, dreams and lives of the unfortunates who were traded away like cattle on the slave markets, has become of a shining beacon of the faith, that thrives on the prosperity instead of the misery of the people within its walls.\nNothing could symbolise this change more than the Eduz-Harhapu, the Temple of Broken Chains, that beating heart of new Yetmesira which the local Yeteferen reverently call Mekyenzelet. Its outer walls are decorated with the shattered remnants of the slave chains that were removed during the grand liberation, when the slavers were struck down. Grateful former slaves and the faithful have attached small bells and chimes to the chains, so even the slightest breeze causes a melodious jingle. Within its walls a series of terraced garden rows leading up to the central ziggurat provide shade beneath the trees planted there, a soothing breeze coming in from the sea rustling their leaves even on the hottest summer day. \nThe temple itself has been marvellously decorated with mosaics and wood carvings from generous donations made by pious merchant princes, who no longer participate in the flesh trade. Instead they now sell the rich grain harvests of Madrizurel to hungry mouths all across the Gulf of Rahen and bring the luxuries found on these shores back with them to Yetmesira."

Half a day’s journey from Mewojala, it is here that a monumental bastion of faith has been erected. \nRising above the solitary rock almost two hundred meters above the plains below the temple, called Eduz-Šarellu, can only be reached by a series of stairs winding around the circumference of the rock, or a system of wind-powered lifting platforms. Here the local priesthood of the Sun Cult watches over the lands of northern Denibari, determined to shield the lands under their protection from the malign influences that may emanate from the fetid southern swamps.\nAnd the people of Mewojala are grateful for their unwavering vigilance, and travel en masse to the base of the rock at each major festival day of the solar calendar, celebrating their resilience and faith in Surael, who wards them from the Malevolent Dark. It is during this time that enormous damask banners interwoven with gold and silver thread are hung from the edges of the rock plateau, depicting legendary tales of Surael and His Chosen emissaries."

 bulwar_flavour.320.d:0 "Sigilan, the old imperial capital of Fangaula, has seen many rulers, and endured many changes. The spread of the Sun Cult throughout its former dominion is just the latest such change. For many people, the idea of a supreme deity embroiled in a constant struggle against a malevolent outside force, that died and was reborn, is not too divergent from their formerly held beliefs, which eased the transition towards a belief in Surael.\nNow, an island in the harbour of Sigilan, connected to the mainland via a processional causeway, contains the most significant symbol of this spiritual change in circumstances, the Alabatsoba Kenetiledin. On this islet the Temple of Incandescent Sunset, or Eduz-Erbusuranqul, rises from the waves, the maroon-coloured glazed clay tiles of the ziggurat glittering in the sun. Each sunset, the entire temple appears as if aflame, a true marvel on full display for every fisherboat and trading vessel seeking the safety of the harbour before nightfall.\nUnique for a temple of the Sun Cult, the sacred gardens of the Temple of Incandescent Sunset are not only found above, but below the waves as well. The temple islet is surrounded by an aquatic garden full of colourful corals and kelp, wafting gently with the currents and enticing swimmers to explore their beauty."

 bulwar_flavour.321.d:0 "The fortress city of Azka-szel-Udam has been the sole stronghold of the Sun Cult on the southern shores of the Gulf of Rahen ever since the times of Maqet the Liberator. Holding out against repeated invasion attempts from the surrounding gnollish tribes for centuries, it only fell after more than five hundred years of stubborn resistance. \nNow, with the former lands of Dasmazar once again in the hands of the faithful, it was a foregone conclusion that the site of the Eduz-Diparkettu, the Temple of Truth’s Beacon, which was desecrated during the era of gnollish occupation, was swiftly restored to its former glory.\nRising up on a promontory above the harbour bay, the temple ziggurat differs from the traditional Bulwari temples. Its top does not just contain a ceremonial platform but a lighthouse tower decorated with traditional red and white birmi murals that contains an eternal flame burning in an oil basin inscribed with potent light magic.\nThis beacon of Surael’s truth shines day and night, a silent but defiant sign to all who approach that this city and its people reside within Surael’s Garden. Maqeti sailors, whether they are legitimate merchants or privateers coming home after raiding slaver vessels, feel their spirits lifting whenever they see the gleaming light of the beacon on the horizon. But those who stand in opposition to Surael and His children fear to stand in the glare of the beacon’s light, all their lies and deceptions exposed."

 bulwar_flavour.322.d:0 "Izmeri, the city of black stone, half built into the cliffs of the Taseh Tiskesh hills, half submerged beneath the coastal shallows, is certainly one of the more unique settlements to be found in eastern Sarhal. Inhabited both by human and lizardfolk Tanizu, its true origins are shrouded in mystery, but it serves as one of the most important permanent settlements found in Ishyamtumu.\nWith the arrival of the Sun Cult to these wild untamed lands, selecting Izmeri as the seat of one of the main temples of the region was a natural choice. Built upon a foundation of the glistening black stone but using a pale sandstone for its actual construction, the Gekeresane or Temple of Blessed Dawn sits directly on the shore, with its sacred garden climbing the cliffs in a series of terraced fields. Stairs connect the central platform around the ziggurat of Eduz-Halwašattu both with the cliff dwellings above and the submerged residences of the more aquatic inhabitants of the city.\nWithout fail, the rising sun is greeted each dawn by a polyphonic chorus of the devout who gather along the shore, celebrating their joy at the return of Surael’s Light to the world. On the high festival days, the faithful assemble in the early hours of the morning and send out intricately woven garlands spun both with colourful land flowers and sea plants and glowing with the light of bioluminescent moss and algae on the waves towards the horizon, where their gentle light illuminates the waters in anticipation of the coming dawn."

Built on the shores of the Odogala near the walls of Fojara, its temple gardens in part resemble more a training field than a verdant oasis.\nFor both priesthood and laypeople here are united in their understanding that sometimes it takes a heart filled with noble indignation to wield the blade that protects the innocents and repels the forces of Darkness. The priests of this temple therefore do not lead a life of quiet contemplation, but seek to achieve greater understanding of Surael’s will by testing the endurance of their mortal forms. \nAt any time of day, some amongst their number can be observed to practice the ritual combat forms for hours on end, with many claiming that exhaustion and ritualised repetition allow them to achieve deep spiritual insights."

 bulwar_flavour.324.d:0 "The location of Kvangraak in the middle of the vast savanna is not due to mere random choice: the city was founded in order to control access to the subterranean Dao genie palace of Esuvrem. With the Sun Cult reigning supreme over this part of the gnollish savanna, a large temple complex has been erected over the cave entrance to the genie palace.\nThis temple, called Eduz-Pazrikettu, the Temple of Hidden Truth, or Zedrekhtidet Afakkan in the gnollish tongue, is decorated with delicate but sturdy metal workings, from mural plates to decorative railings along the ziggurat levels, the product of the concerted efforts of the many master blacksmiths that call this city their home.\nWhile the devotion of the local gnolls to Surael and his struggle against the forces of Darkness cannot be doubted, some remnants of their former belief in Kvanga persist in their reluctance to discard what others might consider unsalvageable, and their dogged persistence to tease out hidden meanings and buried secrets from seemingly mundane texts or artefacts.\nThis predilection has earned the scholar-priests trained in the halls of the Temple of Hidden Truth a reputation as some of the most erudite experts regarding the buried secrets of the ancient past. Lucky is the academy where one of their number accepted a teaching position, and it is a costly but wise investment for any would-be treasure hunting expedition to secure the services of such a scholar."

This temple, also known as the Liziontanziór, has been built as a testament of the abiding faith in Surael shown by the Naléni harpies of northeastern Sarhal. \nThe northernmost pillar carries only a large plaza used by the cloistered faithful and visiting pilgrims alike to observe the journey of the sun from the first gentle rays of light arising over the eastern waters to its fiery descent into the waves of the western Gulf of Rahen. Here the assembled faithful fast from dawn till dusk, contemplate the nature of Surael and ponder how they may best serve Him in the Struggle. \nSeamlessly arising from the other pillars are the main buildings of the sanctuary, also given the name Ešir-Mašnasur in Bulwari. Rainwater cisterns and sheltered gardens hidden within the walls of the sanctuary, together with the many fish swarming in the waters below, supply the faithful Daughters of Jasiene cloistered here with all the necessities of life. Some amongst their number even choose to seclude themselves for years on end in spare cells hewn directly into the rock walls of the pillars, accessible only by rope ladder or wings. Across the sanctuary on the mainland, a series of hostelries cater to the needs of the devout pilgrims searching for spiritual enlightenment at this holy site. \nLiziontanziór’s inhabitants employ their cultural predilection for song and storytelling to craft marvellous tales and hymns, all with the aim of bringing the stories of Surael and His Chosen to the hearts and minds of faithful and unbelievers alike. For many pilgrims, experiencing the dawn chorus rising high in the air to greet the rising sun is one of the most profound experiences in their life."

The gold mined in the surrounding hills is shaped by the patient hands of the devout into artifacts of exquisite craftsmanship. Items like an engraved sun disk medallion crafted in the Umba Daabajuqa are considered to be imbued with a potent blessing of Surael and used by the local faithful to ward against the influence of the Malevolent Dark."

Here they purify and rework the Inmucita crystals mined in the surrounding hills into sunstones. The crystals are said to be tears Surael shed for the ancestors of the Tanizu trapped in the machinations of the Malevolent Dark. Meant to be a solace for their ancestors, the evil emanating from the Shadow Swamp attempted to corrupt this blessing. But this taint cannot stand against the purity of faith possessed by the Daughters of Jasiene, and the bright yellow sunstones resulting from their labor are crafted into potent protective talismans and magical foci that find their way even to Bulwar and beyond.

Complementing this are the intricately decorated fountains fed by deep aquifers that nourish the small gardens hidden in the shaded courtyards of the monastery, inviting meditative contemplation.\nBut the Palace of Blessed Winds, or Eklu-Halwašag as it is formally known, is not just a meditative retreat. It is here that the Order of Judges maintains its regional headquarters and trains its members to bring justice to the faithful and chase down servants of the Malevolent Dark all across Fangaula and the western Salahad.\nFrom the time the first cool fingers of dawn touch the plateau to the sunset, when the entire Palace appears aflame in the light of the setting sun, acolytes of the Order of Judges can be observed studying law precedents and disputing mock trials in the temperate halls of the Zikavarvrem in their attempt to master their vocation."

Scholars believe that the latter object is a representation of the act of binding a djinn, as it is usually found in the hands of god-kings binding djinns in paintings and sculptures."

Some say that the artifacts could be useful to make new scientific breakthroughs, while others argue that they cannot be used in such a way because the Djinns used magic instead of technology. While the whole discussion was pointless, it left several scholars enraged and almost caused a war between Cannor and Bulwar, but the scholars came with some new ideas to implement."

 desc_ulmisbar_incantation_bowls:0 "An incantation bowl made of mithril, engraved with damestear. The inside of the bowl is inscribed in a spiral, starting in the rim and moving towards the centre. The bowl confused our scholars, because these items were normally made of clay and used by practitioners of conjuration, and this bowl is inscribed with a divination spell, written in an ancient language related to northern Raheni, not to mention their expensive materials of dwarven origin. One of the scholars thinks that the bowl was used in a submersion ritual in which the bowl was placed face down in a vessel full of water, and this, according to the scholar, would 'bind' the future to the recipient, showing it to the magi."
