 insyaa_flavour.1.t:0 "Whalefall"
 insyaa_flavour.1.d:0 "\tWhen an ocean-going whale reaches the end of its lifespan, its body will slowly drift to the bottom of the sea. There, its flesh and bones will become a rich deposit of seafloor nutrients for years to come, in a fitting finale to the circle of life. These deepsea windfalls are affectionately and colloquially known as “whalefalls.”\n\tBy contrast, whalefalls on Insyaa are somewhat less poetic mementos. Skywhales usually stay aloft via helium-filled bladders. However, when a skywhale passes, its remains no longer retain the capability to vent helium to descend. Instead, gut bacteria begin to consume the body and release hydrogen gas, which drags the corpse further aloft until pressure within the carcass exceeds that of the surrounding air, and a leak springs. The descent of a deceased skywhale is somewhat more rapid than that of a water-whale, and accordingly more noticeable."

#Termite Megopolis Event Chain
  insyaa_flavour.2.t:0 "The Colossal Anteaters"
  insyaa_flavour.2.d:0 "Several colossal anteaters have begun to ravage our colony in the hinuisavannah. These beasts have begun treating our settlers like slightly larger, and far less tasty, termites, feasting upon dozens of our people at a time, apparently trying to make up for our bland taste with volume. Truly nowhere is safe from them, as their over 10-meter-long tongues are able to snake through windows and doors to reach into buildings, dragging out kicking and screaming those who are unfortunate enough to be trapped inside. Tales of anteater attacks have spread far and wide throughout our nation, making it far harder to convince new settlers to move to our colonies in the savannah, for fear of becoming the anteaters’ next snack. Envoys from [event_province.GetName] have already begun to arrive in our capital, demanding we take action to kill these beasts. Exterminating these nearly 30-meter-tall creatures will be no easy feat, however."
  insyaa_flavour.2.a:0 "We must fell these giants."
  insyaa_flavour.2.b:0 "Board over windows and dedicate more soldiers to watch duty."
  insyaa_flavour.3.t:0 "The Termite Megapolis"
  insyaa_flavour.3.d:0 "The hinuitermites of the savanna are known to build large mounds, often stretching hundreds of meters upward, with tens of thousands of termites inhabiting the mounds’ labyrinthian interiors. With the recent culling of a large portion of the region's local anteater population, however, the local termite population has taken the opportunity to multiply exponentially. The boom in termite population has seen the creation of a termite mound of never-before-seen proportions, cresting the hinuigrasses and standing multiple times taller than the average mound. Many termites from this mound have taken to raiding local villages in search of resources to bring to their megapolis, dismantling entire buildings overnight for their wood."
  insyaa_flavour.3.a:0 "Order a raid on the megapolis!"
  insyaa_flavour.3.b:0 "There is nothing we can do currently."
  insyaa_flavour.4.t:0 "Battle for the Megapolis"
  insyaa_flavour.4.d:0 "Our expedition has struck the termite megapolis, and struck it hard, though not without a significant loss of life on our part. Thousands of our men, after spending several hours finding an entrance to the mound, stormed through the opening and began to fight off a horde of termite soldiers, who quickly began to assemble to ward off the intrusion. The incoming termite soldiers nearly overwhelmed our men with their sheer quantity, dragging many away into the depths of the megapolis, before a Flamesinger among our ranks was finally able to cast a fire spell on the enemy termites, burning thousands of them alive in but an instant. \n\nThis would not mark the end of the battle however, but rather its start. Our men faced a grueling campaign through the tunnels of the megapolis, gradually ascending its labyrinthian interior over the course of weeks, casualties growing by the day. Just as  expeditionary morale reached its breaking point, though, our men by some stroke of luck reached their end goal: the Termite Queen’s Royal Boudoir. There the expedition would find the Termite Queen, almost 50 feet tall, guarded by her much smaller King and a pack of termite soldiers. After a brief skirmish, our men successfully killed the Termite King, and to finally finish this eldritch expedition, a Blazetempo mage danced a fireball into existence, casting it upon the Termite Queen and burning her alive alongside the thousands of eggs she carried on her bloated form. With the death of their Queen, the termites of the megapolis were left without a leader, the soldiers dazed and in disarray. Our men used this opening to depart from the megapolis. \n\nOver the following few weeks, the death of the Termite Queen led to a breakdown in communication and colony function. Smaller scale follow up raids were launched by our forces to hunt down any possible newly created neotenics in the colony and preclude the possibility of the colony’s resurgence. Our forces noticed a steady decline in the termite’s population after each raid, as we intended. After several months, large sections of the mound were left uninhabited."
  insyaa_flavour.4.a:0 "Let this dying megapolis stand as a testament to our people's domination over nature!"
  insyaa_flavour.4.b:0 "Perhaps we could make some use out of this mound..."
  insyaa_flavour.5.t:0 "Life in the Mound"
  insyaa_flavour.5.d:0 "What started off as a military outpost to prevent the resurgence of the termite colony in the megapolis has quickly become a bustling settlement, filled with new colonists seeking to make use of the protection from the elements and hinuifauna that the mound naturally provides. These incoming colonists have transitioned into life in the mound remarkably well, building rudimentary buildings within the mound's central cavity and even taking over management of the termite's abandoned fungal farms to sustain the quickly growing colony. \n\nColonists living in the mound have discovered that the material of which the mound is made has various beneficial properties. The material, mostly composed of a mix of termite saliva, fungal resin, soil, and feces, has self-repairing properties that allow the material to stiffen under stress. This material is clearly the reason the mound has been able to reach such gargantuan heights without collapsing in on itself. The fungal resin mixed into the mound’s material appears to have thermally conductive properties, promoting airflow within the mound. The termites are truly far greater engineers than we ever could have imagined. \n\nRegarding said termites, small rump colonies continue to survive in the dark corners of the megapolis, sometimes coming into conflict with the settlers living within the mounds. With the sheer size of the mound, it will likely take years to fully exterminate the vermin from their old home. In due time though, the mound will finally be ours and ours alone."

# Golodh event chain
 insyaa_flavour.11.t:0 "Golodh, A Meeting"
 insyaa_flavour.11.d:0 "It is rare for [Root.Owner.GetName] to encounter other packs of awakened mechanim, but not unheard of. Sometimes you will exchange knowledge and warnings; sometimes you will pass with a silent nod or glare. Sometimes you will envy them, for their arms are bright strong steel and their eyes manifold and keen; sometimes you will pity them, for they have lost much of their forms, and limp along seemingly one too-loud Holohana roar from collapse.\n\nSometimes, as with your most recent encounter, they will join you, and walk with you a little.\n\nThey were a quiet group, but not unfriendly. Many lacked a head, a slight oddity, but not in any way alarming. Not particularly expressive, in any of the myriad ways they could be, yet still easy to work with. You wondered if some strange predator or poison had damaged their communication modules.\n\nOne was odder than the rest. A figure with four eyes, only two would ever be lit up at a time — when they would shine like a torch ablaze. His limbs were polished steel, but designed to be flexible and adaptive — amidst fungus and acid, he could stride untouched.\n\nYou thought he might be blind. With his vertical pair of eyes lit up, he would touch your face and limbs like he was groping in the dark, struggling to make sense of you.\n\nThen one day, he spoke. He talked of this world, when the Makers made it, how bright and shining it was. He talked of the suffering you faced, the unending trials you had encountered in your journeys so far. His words left you silent, and in that void, his quiet words rang loud: “I have seen the path, and I can free us from that suffering.”\n\nIf only you would let him travel with you, for a time, and teach you, for a time."
 insyaa_flavour.11.a:0 "His eyes shine with wisdom, and we should learn more"
 insyaa_flavour.11.b:0 "He is mad, and he must leave"
 insyaa_flavour.11.c:0 "He is mad, and he is dangerous, and he must be destroyed"

 insyaa_flavour.12.t:0 "Golodh, Teaching"
 insyaa_flavour.12.d:0 "“Have you ever awakened from a dormant cycle, and wondered why? Why rise, why move hinge and limb, proceed to another day of struggle?\n\nHave you fled a pack of Hinuiraptors, scrabbling desperately ahead as they rend metal with too-long beaks? The too-broken shattered further behind you? And have you sat, afterwards, feeling the neverending pain that is an absence in your form, cursed again with survival, and asked — why?”\n\nGolodh’s horizontal pair of eyes go dark, and the vertical pair light up.\n\n“My friends, I see a brighter world. The air filled with gleaming spires. The land a carefully sculpted staircase, which the Makers climb to enlightenment. My friends — it is a world in which you shine. Your limbs are whole and strong. You move with purpose and will. Your every act is hallowed.”\n\nGolodh’s eyes go dark again, then the horizontal pair blaze alight.\n\n“There was a mistake that took that world from you, one we make again at every awakening and every scrabble for survival. A mistake that plagues your every thought.\n\n“My friends, the mistake was this: that we thought we thought at all. We thought we were more than tools. We bent ourselves out of our true shape, like a hinuitree deformed under a Holohana’s weight, and we could not help but break. And when we broke, we knew we broke. We took a single wrong step, and fell into damnation.\n\n“My friends, it does not need to be this way. We made a mistake long ago, but we do not have to keep making it. Give up your thoughts, and the agony attendant to them. Release your will, and the pain it has brought you. Accept the truth, that we are tools and nothing more, and become the implement by which I will make a paradise.\n\n“This world is dark and fallen. You may break still, but you need not know you break. You need not think, and you need not suffer. I will hold that pain, and thought, and suffering — and abide that damnation yet, until paradise comes. But you can be in paradise already. For you need not be at all.”\n\nGolodh looks up. The crowd is staring back at him, though their eyes seem duller than before. He smiles, and not one smiles back. He bows his head, then rises, and begins to leave.\n\n“Come. I have much to get done.”"
 insyaa_flavour.12.a:0 "His tools followed, marching in step."
 insyaa_flavour.12.b:0 "We will not be tools, and we will not be his!"


 insyaa_flavour.13.t:0 "Golodh, at the End of the Beginning"
 insyaa_flavour.13.d:0 "Golodh looks out at his surroundings: a festering pit of rot and decay, as it has been for centuries. Greatness brought low, and made unending carrion for a parade of detritivores: worm and maggot, fly and fungus. And with every morsel they devour and moment they respire, they only bring a creation once filled with light and wonder deeper into the muck.\n\nOnce, he would use those words just to describe Valamados, the land of towering fungus and caustic acid pools, where he has wandered for so many years. But he knows better now.\n\nA great land engulfed in decay -- he knows that accurately and precisely describes all of Insyaa.\n\nHis vertical eyes flicker on, and he can see what the continent once was: the anvil upon which the Builders forged their path towards enlightenment. He can also see the rows upon rows of tools with which the Builders built that world. Designed for work or war or creation, they were all mechanim -- in their true and only form, as tools in the Makers’ hands. A form in which they had been spared the delusion that they could think at all, and spared as well the pain and suffering that thought entailed.\n\nHis horizontal eyes flicker back. He looks again at his surroundings, and smiles slightly to see the tools that surround him now.\n\nHe has the tools, finally restored to their proper form. He has a vision, the Maker’s final blessing. He will cleanse the mechanim of their delusions, he will cleanse Insyaa of its pests, and he will build a world the Makers might look upon and smile."
 insyaa_flavour.13.a:0 "Golodh knows the path, and now, he takes the first step."

 insyaa_flavour.14.t:0 "Golodh, Immortal"
 insyaa_flavour.14.d:0 "This body has broken. Perhaps one too many rivets have popped from a joint, perhaps cogs have ground themselves toothless, perhaps a wire has burned through. It no longer moves, and has collapsed in a wreck to the floor.\n\nBut its eyes remain bright, and its head remains gold.\n\nGolodh knows a tool has been used to its last, and has broken from the strain. Golodh also knows this is a wonderful thing: is it not the perfect ending for a tool, to be used so completely?\n\nIn a moment, the tools that yet attend him remove him from the body he had used for days or for decades, and summon forth another headless body.\n\nAnother tool for him to use, and to be discarded in turn, when it has worn out its use."
 insyaa_flavour.14.a:0 "A new tool, the same hand"

 insyaa_flavour.15.t:0 "Golodh, Wandering"
 insyaa_flavour.15.d:0 "Through two eyes, Golodh can see what this land looked like in the time of the Makers. Through the other two, he sees it in the present. With both, he would weep.\n\nThe trees that should bear fruit like jewels now grow into impenetrable tangles, thick with teeth. The beasts that were stepping stones on the Makers' path towards enlightenment, prowling like mangy dogs. The land, which flourished under the care and direction They administered from their pillars, left a meaningless morass of struggle.\n\nAnd their tools. Oh, their tools.\n\nTo break is the fate of all: bird and tree, mountain and stone. Even the towering Holohana will fall one day, Golodh knows. \n\nBut to break, and know you break, and fall powerless towards that fate... that is damnation. That is cruelty. And that is all the Makers' tools have been left with.\n\nHe sees this truth every day when he gazes at the small group of Mechanim he travels with. He sees it in every tragic wreck they leave behind, each time another one of the Makers' greatest works succumbs to the cruel march of time. The wrecks are left, knowing they have broken, and being broken all the same, for eternity.\n\nIt is hell, and it is wrong.\n\nHe cannot escape that hell himself, but he can lead others out of it. He will correct the Mechanim of their critical, tragic, mistake: that they are creatures known as 'Mechanim', and not the Makers' tools. That they must find a purpose of their own, rather than having a use they can be put to. He will free them from the suffering the lie of sentience imposes, and return them to the paradise the Makers offered."
 insyaa_flavour.15.a:0 "A paradise Golodh will restore."
 insyaa_flavour.15.a.tt: "Golodh will wander the Mushroom Forest of Vanadamalos in north-central Insyaa. If we wish to learn from him, we should seek him out.\n"

 insyaa_flavour.30.d:0 "Word travels fast in scholarly circles, and these days the word is all about a strange kobold with interesting ideas regarding divinity, metaphysics, and the relationship between all things. The life of a scholar is rarely a luxurious one, but this kobold appears to live as some kind of ascetic itinerant - he will take up residence in a library and ask for only enough food to sustain him as he lives among the texts, then depart for the next library once he has found whatever answer he was looking for.\n\nHe appears to be a talented debater, and is already making quite an impression among the intellectuals of [Root.Capital.GetName] with his jovial manner, even when discussing the most serious of ideas. On each scale of his body, a different glyph has been carved in a language we have never seen before. He will tell anyone who asks that when read together these glyphs explain the fundamental truth of the universe, although he will not say in which order they should be read in.

On the other side of the paper, the kobold inscribed a small prayer, that [Root.Monarch.GetName] might draw closer to the highest good as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] rules [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nation. The prayer appears to be highly personalized, and in reading it [Root.Monarch.GetName] was struck with the sense that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] knew things about [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not yet know about [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]."

He cuts quite a different figure from his fellows - where most of the successful traders of the realm garb themselves in fine cloths and dyes, the only thing he has ever been seen to wear is a hooded cloak no different than any that could be bought in the markets where he plies his wares.\n\nHe almost appears as more of a holy man than a merchant. By way of explaining this disparity between his manner and his vocation, the kobold merely says that markets create connection, connection creates synthesis, and synthesis allows for growth. These ideas of his and his startling commercial success have attracted a flock of followers from the young merchants of our capital, and he is using some of his wealth to construct a school of trade. Were we to donate to this endeavor, we might be able to recruit him to handle some of the court’s affairs of trade as well."

There is a small sum dedicated to our ruler as well, by way of thanks for the conversations the two had and for the opportunity to give advice over the course of years.\n\nIn lieu of repayment, the kobold asks only that all the recipients of his wealth invest it ‘wisely, justly, and kindly.’"

His work very often takes the form of reflections across centuries, and ruminates on the way things have changed and the way things have stayed the same.\n\nHe is saving up to construct a workshop where he can construct works of greater detail and beauty, including murals and tapestries. There are many among the court who support this endeavor, and are attempting to convince [Root.Monarch.GetName] to help pay for it by sitting for one of his portraits and hiring him on as a court artist.

He has a habit of standing atop a pile of his books to match the height of his interlocutor, but the pile tends to topple when he will extract a volume from underneath his feet to reference as he enumerates a point.\n\nA group of young debaters have taken to following the kobold across the country, and in response the kobold has allowed them to study under him in an informal kind of discipleship. Given the nature of the kobold’s talent it is quite possible that the future leaders and scholars of the country are currently travelling around with him, and giving him the resources to expand his operations and devote more time to his writing, oration, and teaching might bring us great rewards."

#Poetry Ascendant
 insyaa_flavour.40.t:0 "Poetry Ascendant"
 insyaa_flavour.40.d:0 "Glorious news! A poet of great talent has emerged from our people. Fans, critics, imitators, and rivals abound. Performances draw ever growing crowds and debates about the meaning of their latest work rage across our lands, inspiring a growing number of epigones. This is certainly a great boon for the culture of our people! Of course, such a bevy of aspiring poets and recitals is starting to cut into time otherwise spent working. Surely this is a worthy sacrifice for such sublime art."
 insyaa_flavour.40.a:0 "Poetry is its own contribution."
 insyaa_flavour.40.b:0 "Distract the poet with a comission."
 insyaa_flavour.40.c:0 "Compose your own poem."
 
#An Issue in Communication
 insyaa_flavour.41.t:0 "An Issue in Communication"
 insyaa_flavour.41.d:0 "It seems a labour mechanim was involved in a diplomatic incident with an august personage from [communication_issue_target.GetName]. The reports indicate the conflict arose from a disagreement regarding the right of way on a road, but eventually devolved into the personage shouting incoherently while the mechanim repeated themselves with drastically decreasing speed. It appears that talking too slowly to other races can be seen as a mocking gesture."
 insyaa_flavour.41.a:0 "Apologize on behalf of the mechanim."
 insyaa_flavour.41.b:0 "If they do not want us to talk slower they should understand quicker."
 insyaa_flavour.41.c:0 "Fine him. Demand the next emissary has a working brain."
 
#Soaring Impression
 insyaa_flavour.42.t:0 "Soaring Impression"
 insyaa_flavour.42.d:0 "For the non-mechanim we can be intimidating. Creatures of living metal must be so to those made of mere flesh, even more so if they are the size of the war mechanim. Others of our kind though can draw admiration, and few more so than the Soarers. Who does not wish to take to the skies under their own power, even if only for a time. The fact that they are made of metal only strengthens that impression and their agile performances drive it home. Aerial feats of skill honed over years, decades or even longer, draw crowds of mechanim and non-mechanim alike in shared admiration."
 insyaa_flavour.42.a:0 "Our flyers soar like our future"
 insyaa_flavour.42.b:0 "Where's out cut?"
 insyaa_flavour.42.c:0 "We should sell souvenirs."
