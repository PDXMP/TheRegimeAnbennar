# Event Titles, Descriptions, and Choices
  flavor_empire.1.t:0 "Opportunist Imperial Grandmaster"
  flavor_empire.1.d:0 "Emperor, the Aldresian Grandmaster has sent a curious letter to us. It seems the Imperial Grandmaster is fairly ambitious and offers any assistance at all to our political machinations. \n\n Perhaps this is a good opportunity for us to further our position, shore up the Empire, or even use against our rival. But maybe the Grandmaster has forgotten their place as neutral knights of the Empire?"
  flavor_empire.1.a:0 "Let the Aldresian's dig up 'dirt'"
  flavor_empire.1.b:0 "We need adept administrators"

  flavor_empire.5.b:0 "Send in the guards!"

  flavor_empire.6.c:0 "Assail both"

  flavor_empire.14.t:0 "Crothani Chicanery"
  flavor_empire.14.d:0 "“I am not crazy!”\n\n“Who let you in this time, Carlián? Nevermind, let me guess - are you here about Crothán again?”\n\n“The bastards swapped the numbers!”\n\n“Yes, the last three times you said that made your stance very clear. Seriously, does the “Lord-Elector” on the door mean nothing to y-”\n\n“And they just let him get away with it! Couldn't be Saulion, not the illustrious Goodelf! Lying straight to the Diet!”\n\n“I am telling you for the fourth time - even if what you're saying about Saulion's intent is true, a single instance of the year being written as 972 instead of 927 is not a basis for a court case.”\n\n“So what, are we supposed to just ignore it? Are you saying this blatant discrepancy means nothing?”\n\n“Yes to both parts…”"
  flavor_empire.14.a:0 "“...but I'll send a letter to the Diet and let them know of this. Leave now.”"
  flavor_empire.14.b:0 "“...so we'll have to do something we're not supposed to and assign meaning to it. Leave for now.”"

  flavor_empire.15.t:0 "Damescrown's Ultimatum"
  flavor_empire.15.d:0 "“A mere miswrite? That's the basis for your claim to Crothán?”\n\n“Well, no, as I already told Your Highness, it's a clear proof of forge-”\n\n“Are you a fool, or do you just take me for one? It's a single line on a single page that has a single date's year and decade swapped around, and you want their Free City rights revoked over that?”\n\n“I'm not a fool, and certainly don't take Your Highness for one. Whether the Lord-Elector will share my opinion when the next Imperial Election occurs remains to be seen.”\n\n“Threats used to be more subtle.”\n\n“It seems we are in agreement then - it's better to return things to how they used to be.”"
  flavor_empire.15.a:0 "“A brave attempt. The criers will spread news of how daring Crownsman skullduggery is.”"
  flavor_empire.15.b:0 "“Fine. The damned city came from a clerical error, so shall it be undone by one.”"

  flavor_empire.16.t:0 "The Emperor Refuses!"
  flavor_empire.16.d:0 "“An Emperor who doesn't listen to his subjects?! Might as well place an ape with a magic staff on the Dove Thro-”\n\n“No. Not listening to any more of this. Out of my office, out of this city, and if I ever see you again anywhere near Damescrown I'm getting a front row seat to your drawing and quartering. Guards!”\n\nThe news about our “pathetic strong-arming attempt” spread fast. By some miracle, we were successfully able to mitigate some of the damage to our prestige by backtracking, proclaiming that it was all just a mistake on our part. Whether it's better to be seen as fools or backstabbers remains to be seen, as is whether or not Crothán will want anything to do with us after this."
  flavor_empire.16.a:0 "“I guess that lawyer isn't the only crazy one now...”"

  flavor_empire.17.t:0 "The Emperor Accepts!"
  flavor_empire.17.d:0 "Carlián seemed a bit shaken by our approach, but the gamble paid off - the Emperor fully accepted our demands, acknowledging our rightful claims to the city and overturning the decision of the Imperial Diet of 1223. Crothán may try to protest this decision all they want, but what use is citing procedural law before the Emperor's decree?"
  flavor_empire.17.a:0 "It's time to take back what's ours."

  flavor_empire.18.t:0 "Crownsman Turnabout!"
  flavor_empire.18.d:0 "Horrible news arrived out of nowhere - Damescrown convinced the Emperor that they have a claim to our land using some truly ridiculous “evidence”. The decision of the Imperial Diet of 1223 has been overturned, we are no longer a Free City, and any further actions of Damescrown to take our city are now considered legally justified. What hope could there possibly be for us?"
  flavor_empire.18.a:0 "Reject the claim, lodge a formal appeal to the Diet."
  flavor_empire.18.b:0 "Rally the militia! They can take our city from our cold, dead hands!"
  flavor_empire.18.c:0 "There's nothing left to do but surrender peacefully."

  flavor_empire.19.t:0 "A Minor Complication"
  flavor_empire.19.d:0 "Evidently, citing procedural law does have a use - due to Crothan's loud complaints everyone in the Empire is scrutinizing our next moves. The Emperor's decision is final and absolute, but we will have to be patient, unless we want to be considered warmongers afraid of due process."
  flavor_empire.19.a:0 "Rectifying this has been overdue for centuries, what's a few more years?"

  flavor_empire.20.t:0 "Orcish Petitioners"
  flavor_empire.20.d:0 "Generations ago, a new enemy was unleashed on Cannor. Once the subject of Dwarven legends, encountered only by those few fools who dared to tread upon their claims under the Serpentspine, orcs were a distant myth. Then came Korgus Dookanson, at the head of the Greentide, and the orcs were a terrible reality. The campfire tales and children's stories warning of their savagery hardly did their multitudes justice. Many of our youth went to fight against the tide, but the Empire made no official effort to intervene in the east, preparing to defend ourselves if the Marcher Lords should fail. The Greentide was halted, and the orcs, or so it seemed, were contained.\n\nEven now [Root.Monarch.GetName] maintained a contingency plan should orcs ever break the border of the Empire, battle tactics and fallback lines, but today, they have been rendered pointless. A band of orcs stand before the Imperial Throne, their hands unbound, their heads held high, their weapons… left at the door.\n\n“Fealty…?” [Root.Monarch.GetName] struggles to contain [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] surprise.\n\n“If ya'd have us.” The lead orc isn't quite fluent in the common tongue, but they speak clearly enough. “War-Chief Corin came from the west, an' we're loyal to her now, so we come west to serve a worthy leader. We's good fighters, ya could use a few good fighters. Or ya little-chief princes could…”"
  flavor_empire.20.a:0 "Allow them to swear fealty to the empire and delineate their rights under Imperial Law."
  flavor_empire.20.b:0 "Attempt to bar their entry, we have seen what their kind does to civilization."
  EOA_20_pulse_accept_TT:0 "By codifying the right for orcs to live in within the Empire, we will be opening the princes to new migration events. Any prince turning away these immigrants will harm our mutual relations, as this is now a breach of Imperial Law."
  EOA_20_pulse_deny_TT:0 "These orcs will seek to bypass our authority by seeking asylum from the princes. One wave of migration will occur, it is up to the princes to admit or refuse these orcish emigres."

  flavor_empire.20001.t:0 "DEBUG end of the Orcish Influx"
  flavor_empire.20001.d:0 "This is a hidden event to prevent mass numbers of orcs from migrating to the empire without permission. If you see this, please report it."
  flavor_empire.20001.a:0 "No, more orcs!"

  flavor_empire.21.t:0 "Orcish Settlers in the Empire"
  flavor_empire.21.d1:0 "A band of Orcs, sworn to Corin's sword and shield, have arrived in our land and are seeking to settle down. Imperial Law grants them full rights as a citizen species and they have permission to live and work anywhere in the Empire, so refusing them could upset the Imperial Court. Orcs are strong, but by some accounts rowdy; it is even claimed that they are naturally prone to violence."
  flavor_empire.21.d2:0 "A small tribe of orcs, fleeing turmoil or persecution in Escann, have come to us seeking refuge. While orcs are best known as the monsters who perpetrated the Greentide, nearly all of the original generation of orcs have passed away - perhaps this younger generation can integrate into Cannorian society, if given the chance. They profess loyalty to Corin, having denounced their ancestors' forever-wars, and now seek to join the crusade against evil across Halann."
  flavor_empire.21.a:0 "Welcome to [Root.GetName], you may live and work in [eoa_21_pulse_target.GetName]"
  flavor_empire.21.b:0 "Welcome friends, there's work for reliable hands in [eoa_21_pulse_target.GetName]"
  flavor_empire.21.c:0 "Perfect timing, we are in need of reinforcements."
  flavor_empire.21.e:0 "You may not settle in our lands, go back to the ruins you already made."

  flavor_empire.22.t:0 "On the Matter of Dragons"
  flavor_empire.22.d:0 "Spike-lined pits, acidic landmines, drake-fire, thousands upon thousands of spears and arrows and sling-stones; what conceivable hell have our troops not endured to claim this measly stretch of land? The diminutive lizard-people, whom gnomes named “kobild” -for lizard- and who thence took the name “kobold” as their own, fight for their land so fiercely, you'd think they might have done a bit more with it. Their farms are smaller than the cottage-gardens of the Small Country, their villages dot the landscape more densely than trees, each boasting scarcely a hundred persons each. The only truly impressive thing they have to defend -save the traps themselves- are their mines. Their impossible ant-hill excavations bore through bedrock to haul thousands of pounds of every metal imaginable to the surface, and for what? To build more traps. These beings are an enigma, but they're our enigma to unravel now.\n\nAs we consolidate our foothold on the Dragon Coast, we must make a decision about how to deal with the kobolds for the long-term. Some call for them to be wiped out, though that would be no quick and easy task even if we do dedicate the military to such a purpose. Another faction argues they should be driven back; generations ago, they emerged from under the mountains, and countless hundreds of thousands are said to still dwell there; surely they can survive returning to their own homelands?\n\nOthers yet argue that these are ultimately people. Strange people, about whom we know rather little, and who seemingly know even less about us, but people nonetheless. They can learn our ways. They can adapt, and so can we. We could give them a bit of space, earn their trust, bargain with the local tribes -sorry, trivuak- and integrate them into our society. Who knows what kind of marvels they might work on Halann, when they stop spending all their time building traps?"
  flavor_empire.22.a:0 "With respect and patience, they will learn to love us, in time."
  flavor_empire.22.b:0 "Let them run back to their caves, or stay and learn to be useful."
  flavor_empire.22.b_TT:0 "The conquest of the Dragon Coast will continue apace, as will the flight of the kobolds into their ancestral caves."
  flavor_empire.22.c:0 "These savages cannot be given the chance to organize a response!"
  flavor_empire.22.c_TT:0 "We will enact a purge of the kobold race. This purge will not cost us a diplomat to maintain. Many kobolds will attempt to flee into the caverns, but those caught behind our front will be forced to flee into other - hopefully less hospitable - lands."

  flavor_empire.22001.t:0 "DEBUG end of the kobold exodus"
  flavor_empire.22001.d:0 "This is a hidden event to end the migration of kobolds fleeing into the Empire and Lencenor. If you see this, please report it."
  flavor_empire.22001.a:0 "Wait... you don't really have to stop, we could build you a city-state! With missions!"

  flavor_empire.23.t:0 "Strangers Under Our Feet"
  flavor_empire.23.d1:0 "It started quietly, strange sightings in the countryside of small beings sneaking about under cover of darkness. Things started to go missing, small things that were quickly missed -kitchen knives, soup bowls, the wheels off a child's toy- and food, straight out of pantries and cupboards. Rumors began to circulate of reptilian beings in the dark places under our feet, in sewers and catacombs, or new basements that seemed to crop up overnight with no apparent point of entry. Before panic could set in, adventurers stepped up, but they were too late to stop the invasion.\n\nOur city has become infested by kobolds; what's more, by kobold refugees. Those caught by the adventurers surrendered quickly, pleading for mercy in broken Common, each providing a fragment of the greater picture: a great tragedy is underway on the Dragon Coast. Kobolds, dead by the tens of thousands. Some cheer to see Malliath's monster-spawn lain low, but it's hard to feel triumphant when a helpless being is sobbing at your feet.\n\nImperial Law is clear: kobolds are people, and have the same rights as human or elven refugees. …but the Imperial Court doesn't need to know if we refuse them, right?"
  flavor_empire.23.d2:0 "It started quietly, strange sightings in the countryside of small beings sneaking about under cover of darkness.

Kobolds, dead by the tens of thousands. Some cheer to see Malliath's monster-spawn lain low, but it's hard to feel triumphant when a helpless being is sobbing at your feet.\n\nAre these beings so different from the Escanni, driven forth by the Greentide? Would Begga forgive us if we sent them away?"
  flavor_empire.23.a:0 "You may live here, ABOVE GROUND, where we can see you!"
  flavor_empire.23.b:0 "Welcome, weary travelers. Come in, clean your claws, join your friends."
  flavor_empire.23.c:0 "No monsters are welcome in our land, you wretched spawn of Mallaith!"

  flavor_empire.24.t:0 "Flight into Lencenor"
  flavor_empire.24.d:0 "It's hard to explain the emotion that a dragonflight evokes. It's an old fear, one that hasn't been felt in Lencenor in over a thousand years, but it's still there, lurking in the back of every mind that knows the story of the Dragonwake. It's a dead dread, the sense that you're probably already done for, but you might have time to tell your loved ones you love them before you're all eaten, burnt, or sliced into ribbons.\n\nIt's equally hard to explain what you feel when you see a wave of tiny dragons surging toward you, but you can think of it as a smaller version of the former. For the gate guards in [eoa_24_pulse_target.GetName], it was just as unexpected as a full-blown dragon flying over.\n\nKobolds charged the city gate the morning when they opened for market, surging in as if they had Nimrith the Red himself snapping at their heels. In a reassuring twist, they aren't being violent, but they also aren't exactly cooperating. They've fled a wave of violence following the invasion of the Dragon Coast, and aren't going to go back without a fight, so now they're our problem."
  flavor_empire.24.a:0 "They're already here, but that doesn't mean we have to like it."
  flavor_empire.24.b:0 "Have you considered living in houses?"
  flavor_empire.24.c:0 "We have enough pests as it is! Disperse them and take their stuff!"

  flavor_empire.25.t:0 "Kobolds on Imperial Soil"
  flavor_empire.25.d:0 "Troutcoast, a small fishing harbor in Exwes. Timberfort, a woodland burgh in Pearlsedge. Neither of these cities would be noteworthy on a normal day, but today both stand out. Indeed, when the report arrived at the Imperial Court describing  kobolds suddenly massing in the Western Dameshead, the steward's first instinct was to ask what century it was. Kobolds hadn't raided through Lencenor in centuries, much less successfully! Further details since have only made things stranger: these are not raiders. They're migrants. Evidently fleeing some conflict in the Dragon Coast, these smallfolk have made it through hell, high water, and the imperial border, and are now squatting outside cities that we should be protecting from such incursions.\n\nNow the emperor is face-to-face with a large family -kendia, per their correction- of the scaly beings, who were spotted by Aldresian Knights trying to sneak into the city of Beepeck. These kobolds have asked [Root.Monarch.GetName] for shelter, not knowing that their words invoke ancient Imperial Law, and now a formal ruling must be made to determine the fate of these three-dozen kobolds, and indeed all their kind who seek refuge on Imperial Soil."
  flavor_empire.25.a:0 "The kobold is a sentient being, and will be treated as one."
  flavor_empire.25.b:0 "Have we not moved to protect these people? Rectify this at once!"
  flavor_empire.25.c:0 "The princes can manage their own cities."
  flavor_empire.25.c_TT:0 "We will not codify the kobolds' rights, but we won't ban their entry either. Each prince that faces the migration will have to make their own decision."
  flavor_empire.25.e:0 "Ugh, scaly little thieves, cast them out!"
  EOA_25_pulse_accept_tt:0 "By codifying the right for kobolds to live in within the Empire, we will be opening the princes to new migration events. Any prince turning away these immigrants will harm our mutual relations, as this is now a breach of Imperial Law."

  flavor_empire.26.t:0 "Tinkers' Protest"
  flavor_empire.26.d:0 "Imperial Law, both ancient and modern, delineates the rights of mages, but we never had to worry about defining what a mage is until recently. Artificery allows anyone to use magic, even without any innate ability. This has long caused anxiety among our magical class, who have sponsored a series of reactionary laws to heavily limit the practice of Artificery. Tensions over these laws have been building for years, but today they reached a flash point: the artificers of [Root.Capital.GetName] have gathered before the palace in peaceful protest. They have set up stands and stalls to show off all manner of strange contraption, and impede the passage of any traveler as they show off how incredible and potentially-useful their inventions are.\n\nWhile this impromptu fair persists, movement through the center of town, and in or out of most government buildings, is nigh-impossible. Their terms are clear: rescind the previous restrictions on the Artificers, or the roads will remain closed indefinitely. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] must make a decision quickly, before our administration grinds to a halt."
  flavor_empire.26.a:0 "If they wanted to use magic, they should have been born mages."
  ANB_estate_artificers_loyalty_refund_tt:0 "When we next revoke a privilege from the Artificers, the loyalty cost will be refunded."
  flavor_empire.26.a_mages_desc:0 "Artificers Disfavored"
  flavor_empire.26.a_artificers_desc:0 "Artificers Disfavored"
  flavor_empire.26.b:0 "These are interesting ideas… We can compromise, if you can deliver."
