 deranne_vengeance_of_tomorrow_title:0 "Vengeance of Tomorrow"
 deranne_vengeance_of_tomorrow_desc:0 "These are dark days for Lencenor. The Moon Party, once a proud and triumphant coalition, has fallen to splinters. Dameria are gone, its capital sacked and the slaughter of the last Silmunas marking the end of the wars. Now, we linger in a precarious situation. As one of the last realms resisting Lorentish domination, it will not be long before the Lorentish recover from the destruction caused by the Lilac Wars and set out to enforce our loyalty.\n\nWe cannot allow this to happen. We must use the shattered state of Lencenor to our advantage and pick up the pieces. Our first obstacle will be right outside our eastern border; the Ordings. Ever since Derhilde set foot upon Lencori soil and destroyed the horseriders, they have limped on in a pitiful state, reminiscing about grander days. It is time we put them out of their misery once and for all."

 deranne_the_final_swing_title:0 "The Final Swing"
 deranne_the_final_swing_desc:0 "With the Ordings once again subjugated beneath Derannic rule, we may set our sights on our true goal: The fall of Lorentainé. The final confrontation is soon upon us, and if fate wills it, we will avenge the fallen and topple the Lorentish tyranny. Yet while our will is strong and our armies lust for vengeance, we must not rush in like fools.The Lorentish, while weakened, are still powerful. Their lands are vast, their allies strong, and while inferior to our Seaflower Knights, the Knights of the Rose are renowned across Cannor.\n\nThankfully, the Siloriels have many enemies, both within and outside their realm. A grand coalition should be formed, one powerful enough to cast down the Lorentish hegemony and usher in a new age for the Lencori. The final swing of honor is upon us, and it will shear off the heads of tyrants who have had it long coming."

 deranne_docks_of_westport_title:0 "The Docks of Westport"
 deranne_docks_of_westport_desc:0 "Ever since the landing of Derhilde’s host in what is now called Westport, the small coastal town has grown immensely. From rich fishing activity to its grand harbor hosting our ducal vessels, its importance is becoming more and more prominent in this age as more and more ships fare out onto the high sea. As our warhorses gallop east once more, our grand warships shall surely follow, and as such it is time we expand our fleet to a size unrivaled."
 deranne_a_withered_rose_title:0 "A Withered Rose"
 deranne_a_withered_rose_desc:0 "Long ago, towards the end of the 14th century, Lorentish armies disgracefully marched upon Deranne and laid waste to countless villages, pillaging the countryside and leaving our realm as a land of smoke and fire. Now, as we march through the tattered gates of Lorentainé, we will finally have our vengeance. The Lorentish rose wilts as our armies march upon the grand city, ready to deliver justice to those who have for so long managed to avoid it. The time of retribution is here, and the Lorentish tyrants will fear our wrath."

 deranne_consulting_the_smiths_title:0 "Consulting the Smiths"
 deranne_consulting_the_smiths_desc:0 "The Daromsforge, one of Lencenor’s finest wonders. Once a fortress constructed by the Damerians of old to oversee its western holdings, it is now not only an important fortification, but also hosts a massive complex of magically enhanced forges producing the finest weapons Lencenor has to offer. While it has long been within our possession, it is time we use it to its full potential. Let us consult the smiths of the great forge, and tell them to let the fires roar like never before, as we prepare for a great march east."

 deranne_the_western_haven_title:0 "The Western Haven"
 deranne_the_western_haven_desc:0 "As our conquests of Lencenor continue and we push our frontier ever forward, our homeland lies far away from the destruction of war. Without the worries of armies ravaging our countryside, Deranne prospers. The vast fields are lush and green and the cities bustle, as both the forges and marketplaces roar with the sounds of hammer and broking. Let this prosperity continue, and let us further bolster our homeland so that it may support the costly efforts of war."

 deranne_rivers_of_wine_title:0 "Rivers of Wine"
 deranne_rivers_of_wine_desc:0 "The rich lands of the Bay of Wines have long been coveted by regional powers, serving as a battleground for the armies of the Lorentish and Anbennarians. Despite this, the Winelords continue to enrich themselves upon vast fields of vineyards and the local trade. Although the Winelords must fall, the valour they showed during the Lilac Wars as they fought at our side has not been forgotten, and we would value their support in our righteous conquest of Lencenor."

 deranne_dwarves_of_the_ruby_title:0 "Dwarves of the Ruby"
 deranne_dwarves_of_the_ruby_desc:0 "The Dwarves of Rubyhold were for ages the most prestigious and influential people in Lencenor, manipulating the region's politics and effectively helping build the Lorentish realm as it stands today. However, with the arrival of the elves this era of domination ended, and the Dwarves have since been cast aside as simple lapdogs of the Lorentish court. Yet the tides are shifting, and as we continue our conquest the King of the Mountain may stand in our way. While we could simply march on and lay siege to their precious hold, there may be an opportunity for us to exploit the bitterness toward their old allies that has simmered in the Ruby Dwarves' hearts for centuries, and turn them to our side. Regardless, their fate now lies in our hands."

 deranne_song_to_the_moon_title:0 "A Song to the Moon"
 deranne_song_to_the_moon_desc:0 "The Derannics have always been a seafaring people. Ever since the long journey of Derhilde and her host, calling back to the days when we pierced the cold breeze of Gerudian waters and landed on the warm shores of Lencenor's western coast . Yet, while our people have always sailed the western seas, there was always a question simmering in our minds; What lies beyond the mists? The elves who first arrived on Cannor’s shores spoke of their homeland destroyed in a great calamity now known as the Day of Ashen Skies. Surely it can be rediscovered once again. It is time we set out on a voyage of discovery, and see how much was truly lost the day Halann itself trembled."

 deranne_into_sornhills_title:0 "Into the Sornhills"
 deranne_into_sornhills_desc:0 "The Sornósti, once a proud people thriving in their hills and with their bountiful vineyards, eventually became lapdogs of the Lorentish and fought against us during the Lilac Wars in battle after battle. Now, while their old allegiances may have faltered, retribution still awaits. Additionally, gaining control over the vast wine-production of the southern hills would be a great boon to our economy and trade."

 deranne_march_north_title:0 "The March North"
 deranne_march_north_desc:0 "With the Lorentish heartland and the Ruby Mountains under our control, our gaze turns to our frontiers. In the north, wine-lords stake their claims as the old order collapses, each desperately seeking allies to save themselves from our advance. They will not succeed. Deep within the magical forest of the Redglades, its elven inhabitants hide in isolation. They too must proclaim their allegiance to us, but may see reason to save their glades from bloodshed. No matter the means, if we seek to proclaim ourselves as the new Lencori hegemon, these scattered states must bend the knee."

 deranne_traditions_of_old_title:0 "Traditions of Old"
 deranne_traditions_of_old_desc:0 "It is well known that our origins lie not in the vast plains of western Lencenor, but rather in the harsh, frozen lands of the far north – Gerudia. While the people who immediately descended from these hardened reavers quickly adapted themselves to the culture of this land's inhabitants, old customs remained. Most notably this is seen in our reputation as capable seafarers, but more subtly within the Skaldhyrric characteristics of the Derannic culture.\n\nThe tradition of tale and song has remained since Derhilde’s landing, and has made Deranne a center of Lencori Bardic Magic, hosting a variety of troubadours and other artists to channel their magic through the beauty of the performance. As our realm expands, we should strive to foster this tradition, spreading it throughout Lencenor to strengthen the unity of our state while binding the church, magic and people together."

 deranne_shrouded_island_title:0 "The Shrouded Island"
 deranne_shrouded_island_desc:0 " Just outside the Lencori coast, beyond the misted waters of the western channel, lies Venaíl, an island inhabited by elves. While their kind are a common sight on Lencori soil, the people of Venaíl have long isolated themselves on their island, interacting little with outsiders except for the occasional merchant vessel. While they are seemingly of little threat, and most people on the mainland have been content to leave them alone in their silent affairs, some are nervous of their position and ability to disrupt our newfound expeditions to the west, where their focus seems to lie. Additionally of interest, the Venaíli elves are quite renowned for their artisanry, specifically within the trades of glass and paper. If we could inspect their work in order to learn and foster their techniques, it may well be beneficial for all."

 deranne_handling_dissenters_title:0 "Handling the Dissenters"
 deranne_handling_dissenters_desc:0 "Ever since our conquest of the Lorentish heartland, its inhabitants have resisted our rule at every step. Spiteful ever since their fall from grace, the old nobility has been averse, continuing with their petty schemes. In the end they think they can loosen our firm hand and reinstall one of their own as king. Foolish dreams of course, yet an obstruction to our efforts. Every day the Lorentish disobey the less legitimate our rule becomes, and if we ever intend to rightly wear the Ruby Crown, every remnant of the old order must fall in line. It is time we deal with this pest, one way or another."

 deranne_power_and_grace_title:0 "Power and Grace"
 deranne_power_and_grace_desc:0 "The elves. A people who came far and rose even higher. Nobody may doubt the influence wielded by the elves across Cannor, nor how fast they came to obtain it. When Derhilde conquered this land long ago, she encountered little but humans and dwarves, yet this is a new age, and ever since Ioriel arrived at the Lorentish court many years ago the elves have wielded immense power throughout the land. While they were less prominent on the Derannic shores, we cannot deny that to rule Lencenor without elven favour wouldn’t truly be to rule. Now that we stand in the place of the old Lorentish kings we must use their old allies, and we should approach the elven strongholds and seek to gain their support."

 deranne_home_of_tales_and_piety_title:0 "Home of Tales and Piety"
 deranne_home_of_tales_and_piety_desc:0 "In the days when our Gerudian ancestors were first integrating themselves into Lencori society, the gradual conversion of the Skaldhyrric faith into the worship of the Regent Court was not a total one. In line with the works of the Skald-priests of Gerudia, the emerging Derannic clergy started composing tales of various gods of the cannorian pantheon, including Castellos, Minara, and most notably Adean, as devoted followers of the Whiterose court.\n\nYet tales have not only been composed to prove our devotion to the gods. From generation to generation, tales and lore of Derhilde and her host are passed on to carry on the legacy of the founding of our people. Likewise, stories of the chivalric battles of the Lilac Wars and the love between Lady Calassa from Deranne and the last Duke of Dameria, Adénn Skylance, are told fervently across the realm. Let us encourage this tradition, so that it may continue to our benefit."

 deranne_westport_voyage_title:0 "The Westport Voyage"
 deranne_westport_voyage_desc:0 "In the far west, across the great ocean once thought to be greater, land has been found. We now stand at the precipice of the long abandoned elven homeland, the fields upon the vast islands lush as it has laid untouched for more than a thousand years. A dream fulfilled when we crossed the sea, this certainly is a time to celebrate, yet we cannot rest. While we are situated quite closely to the rediscovered land of Aelantir, and briefly carry the upper hand, competition will surely not take long to follow. Already bands of adventurers make the great voyage to the west in great numbers, and as the news spreads other realms keenly eye the newfound opportunity. Let us not waste any time. Upon the first sight of land our competitors will see our banner flying proudly on the horizon."

 deranne_under_our_guidance_title:0 "Under our Guidance"
 deranne_under_our_guidance_desc:0 " As our war for justice approaches its resolution, we now find ourselves in control of nearly the entire region. The old tyrants of Lorentainé have been cast down, never to find footing again and instead placed with our dominion. Indeed, as the few remaining lords and dukes swear fealty to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], it is time for us to manifest our victory and take the mantle of the Ruby Crown as rulers of all Lencenor.\n\nBut first we must solidify our conquests, strengthening new and old fortresses to protect from outside foes, as our rule lays the path for a new era of Lencori prosperity."

 deranne_derhildes_will_title:0 "Derhilde's Will"
 deranne_derhildes_will_desc:0 "Long ago, after her father’s death at the hand of the Ordings, a young woman born in the remote hills of Gerudia led one of the greatest reaver hosts that was ever seen on a long, cold voyage south. Across a great sea her people followed, all the way to the lush grasslands of Lencenor – for while vengeance was the quest, there was promise of much more. A promise that Derhilde Reaverqueen would guide her people through a new era, a new land. And guide she did, change she brought – change that would make a legacy to last centuries. \n\nWhile we may have had different motivations than our reaver ancestors, the path was all the same. All throughout Lencenor, the Derannic banner flies true. Upon a mighty throne, our monarch proudly wears the Ruby Crown, its gems a mark of our splendor and its weight a mark of our responsibility. As the bloodstained sword upon the ravaged battlefield shines in the light of sunrise, Lencenor openly faces the new dawn. A dawn guided once more by our hand, as was Derhilde’s will"

 deranne_establishing_dominion_title:0 "Establishing a Dominion"
 deranne_establishing_dominion_desc:0 "Each day the docks bustle as hundreds of men, women and children of every class and background journey across the ocean to chase the dream of a new start. Already, plenty of settlements establish themselves across the coast of Aelantir, venturing further and further into the great unknown. While there is still much to be explored, the vast islands of Endralliande seem peaceful and close enough to Lencenor to pose little risk to new settlers. If we shall expand our Aelantiri influence, controlling these islands will be vital."

 deranne_fall_upon_eastern_winebay_title:0 "Fall Upon the Winebay"
 deranne_fall_upon_eastern_winebay_desc:0 "While the majority of Lencenor now lies firmly within our grasp, the territories at the borders of our domain are still of great interest. Notably, just south of Lorentaíné, lies the trade center of the Eastern Winebay, and at its heart Toarnaire, the renowned City of Thorns.\n\nMen hailing from lands of winelords to the distant borderlands of the Anbennarians alike have lost their lives fighting endlessly over this stretch of land. Each day, merchant vessels and caravans transporting wine aplenty leaves the harbor and gates of the City of Thorns, serving as a vital point of export to the Imperial market. By fully securing the winebay we can establish a solid frontier against any Anbennarian threats, while simultaneously strengthening our hold of the wine trade."

 deranne_the_derannport_title:0 "The Derannport"
 deranne_the_derannport_desc:0 "As our colonies across Aelantir steadily develop, ships filled to the brim with goods ranging from tools and textiles to luxuries like tobacco sail the Uelos’ Lament as they deport from the docks of both Cannor and Aelantir. But as the Aelantiri trade routes continue to expand, it is clear we need to establish a grand entrepôt to strengthen our control over the flow of goods. This coincides with the interests of the D.T.C, who have petitioned the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to invest in the development of a port in the Silsensald Isles, from which they can conveniently oversee their Aelantiri affairs. Let us grant their wish."

 deranne_derannic_behemoths_title:0 "The Derannic Behemoths"
 deranne_derannic_behemoths_desc:0 "‘The skies rumbled as the rain merged with sea, the pitch dark of the ocean vast alighted only by the brief cracks of lightning. Within the storm, the crews of five warships desperately fought its fierce waves to keep from being consumed by the waters they sailed. Yet to their minds, the tempest was a comfort compared to what once sailed behind them, the wrath of what they hoped was lost in the night.\n\nAs the sailors at last cleared the worst of the storm's fury, what should have been a time for relief was instead filled with eerie silence, until the Barrelmen cried out and pointed back into the storm. Within the darkness, a terrifying silhouette could be seen only through the flash of lightning, and as the behemoth emerged through the stormwall, each crewman could see it had as many gunports as a citadel had arrowslits. They could do nothing but leap overboard as the enormous hull lit up the night, the ships they had once sailed proudly ruthlessly torn apart. As the men slowly sunk to the cold depths, they thought they could hear Uelos weep, for he knew his domain was challenged’\n\n  -"The Tale of the Behemoth""

 deranne_rending_of_reavers_title:0 "Rending of Reavers"
 deranne_rending_of_reavers_desc:0 "In The Era of Black Ice, Derhilde and her host were not the only of the Gerudians who dared make an arduous voyage so far across Cannor’s shores. Aye, many a reaver crossed the great ocean in search of plunder and glory. Some returned with great renown, many never got to touch the riches they seeked. Most are not remembered except for a passing remark in the history books, others created legacies that are spoken of even today, like ours.\n\nAmong them stands Reveria. Though our kinship with the Reverians was strong during the founding of our realms, we have long since grown disillusioned. They desperately cling to their guardian origins as a lifeline, a source of old glory and pride. Yet their refusal to adapt with the times have helped them little, as all know they are but a shadow of what they claim to be. We will teach them that there is no virtue in denying change."

 flavour_deranne.1.t:0 "The Western Twilight"
 flavour_deranne.1.d:0 "Standing upon a steep cliff, a gust of wind blowing back his long, dark hair, Adénn looked across the vast ocean to the western horizon. The sea had always been the dominion of Deranne, a force of nature adapted to by centuries of tradition, dating back to the Derhilde and the Era of Black Ice. Despite its dangers, the ocean continued to be a haven for all Derannics, its desolation granting a sense of peaceful solitude. Adénn unsheathed his sword, its steel glistening with the light of the setting sun. It was bestowed to him by his father during his final breaths, fatally wounded in his last battle against the Lorentish just a few years before. The throne was left to young Adénn, and with the realm in chaos and the army in disarray, he could do nothing but sue for peace. Dameria fell only a year later.\n\nAdénn turned east, towards Lorentainé, with hatred in his eyes. The moon party had lost, and the traitors and usurpers of the Rose would now lavish in their victory, Adénns fallen brothers and sisters forgotten in the annals of history. No, he would not accept this fate. Dameria was gone, the old order shattered, but his heart glimmered with hope still. The Lorentish were weak and exhausted, their vassals unruly, and it was commonly known that the man on their throne was a fool, his victory handed to him with little effort of his own. Adenn held up his sword once more before he sheathed it; Justice would be delivered - Deranne would not cower.\n\nAnd so, with a sense of resolution, he mounted his steed and took one last look upon the setting sun, before he rode east"

 estate_deranne_dtc_desc:0 "The Deranne Trade Company is a trading company originally founded by a number of early Derannic trade-settlements in North Aelantir. Since then, the company has rapidly expanded its influence with aid from Lencenor and is now one of the key competitiors within the Aelantiri market. The D.T.C has also expanded its operations in Sarhal, seeking to control the main trade routes flowing into and out of Cannor and to take part in the continents rich markets. Although mainly composed of a wide array of merchants and artisans, the D.T.C is also largely influenced by the Derannic nobility whom hold a large amount of stock in the company, and who wishes to further their own financial interests. While the two factions aren't always aligned, they lead an uneasy peace."
