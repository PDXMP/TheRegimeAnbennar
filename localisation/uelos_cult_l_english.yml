 uelos_events.1.t:0 "Ports of Call Answer the Sea"
 uelos_events.1.d:0 "The girl looked out to the bright cerulean sea, ships dipping above and below the horizon, like pendulums on the waters. She did not know her mother, nor her father. All she had ever known was the city, and the sea beyond it. And that was all she needed, she supposed; she did odd jobs for pay, slept in alleys and under docks, and ate with a view to be envied.\n\nBut one day, as she looked out to sea, she saw a strange sort of ship. Though blue was ever a popular colour amongst sailors, this ship's sails were greener, and as it neared, she could make out the crew. Men and women wore the same greenish cloth, and had strange amulets and jewellery. Some were crafted from shells and such, others from tattered rope and mangled hooks.\n\nShe heard them preach, in common and tongues older, of the primordial Uelos, how he is Lord of the sea, how he can protect your ships, or guarantee you a bounty of fish. Most seemed to dismiss them as ramblers and zealots, but perhaps..."

 uelos_events.2.t:0 "Uelos Worship Spreads in your Ports"
 uelos_events.2.d:0 "The girl stood upon the deck as the winds drove them forwards, out to the port they approached. It had been quite some time since she had left that port, and she had, in years since, finally achieved her dream. The girl was a sailor, heading out to the colonies of [Root.GetName], where she would be by the sea for all her life, and for her there could be no greater treasure in a thousand vaults.\n\nAnd, of course, she would give her thanks to Uelos. The girl would pray beside her hammocks, and sing softly to the oceans as she worked the rigging and sails or scrubbed the decks after a long day. She would toss a gold coin to the waves whenever she survived a storm or a battle. Whenever she made landfall, she would spend the evening with like minded believers. They would tell stories, of themselves, of Uelos, and of what was yet to come. Survival was uncertain on the waves, but every moment of it was a treasure."

 uelos_events.3.t:0 "Uelos Worship Docks at Home"
 uelos_events.3.d:0 "The woman looked out to the port upon which she had grown, sighing happily as she returned. The years away had changed her. No longer a small and shy girl, she was a captain, the pride of [Root.GetName]'s fleet. She saw her home had changed; it had sprawled as its colonies had, with new shipyards and docks - and grander manses for the merchants, of course.\n\nBut she had not come here for idle nostalgia; she had come to be a part of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s court, one of the many captains and admirals in that position, and she was to spread the faith, as they had done to her as a child. She would buy drinks and inventory for sailors and fishermen, both a way to give back to her community and, of course, encourage others to ask about her preaching.\n\nAnd when night fell, and the woman would meet her congregation upon the shore, she saw more and more gather by the day."

 uelos_events.4.t:0 "The Sea Calls"
 uelos_events.4.d:0 "The woman sat in the council chamber, awaiting the arrival of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], to tell them that she and her fellows within his court had been meaning to ask for a more 'official' stance on Uelos worship in the city. And while the others had offered their liege the usuals - power, wealth, glory - she wanted to offer the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] something more. A god who truly cared for them, unlike those others who refused to act.\n\nShe wore her captain's outfit, turquoise and cyan shades draped like she had taken the sea itself as a shroud. And she had a mask, befitting her seniority amongst her brethren; It shone a brilliant bronze, carved to look just like her face. She had been writing as of late, too; stories of Uelos' briney court, of sailfish knights and krakenous heralds, and of the Deep One Himself.\n\nPerhaps the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would just kill her and be done with it, never hearing what she had to say. But maybe, just maybe, she would be given the same chance she gave, those years ago. Nevertheless, she knew her brethren would take action were anything to happen to her."
