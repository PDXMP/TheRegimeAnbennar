beast_memory.2.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName], accompanied by a slowly thinning crowd of loyal retainers and servants, solemnly proceeded out of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] seat of power into the wild. Here [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could get in touch with the noble beasts whose memories form the foundation of the exalted way of life that sustains [Root.Monarch.GetName]. One by one, the warriors and other followers take their leave or are dismissed until eventually the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own at a parting of ways. Now the decision cannot be delayed any further: where will [Root.Monarch.GetName] go?"

To [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] embarrassment, which would no doubt be greater if [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entourage were still around, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] stomach suddenly rumbles loudly. Examining [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] surroundings, [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes courage, as there are many opportunities to sate [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hunger. Off in the middle distance, deer are going about their day, unaware of the two-legged predator close by. Near [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet, rabbits are running around. The nearby trees promise a bounty of ripe, wholesome fruits. With such varied options, what shall be the meal of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"

A bit of unsteadiness on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet makes it abundantly clear that the time for sleep is near. However, since these are not [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] comfortable quarters, a proper resting place must be found first. A nearby thicket, a large tree, and a water hole come to mind as [Root.Monarch.GetName] wearily looks around. As grogginess sets in, where shall the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] get a good night's rest?"

 desc_brave_mongoose_bold_major:0 "In the time when the Three Great Beasts wandered with their progeny, Noble Elephant’s descendent Ubatwir (Authority) lumbered as tall as the mountains, manifesting a gargantuan fragment of the Sky-Headed Beast. Against his matron’s caution, Ubatwir dared Brave Mongoose to battle, for in his hubris he regarded his senior as small and weak.\n\nBrave Mongoose, knowing when to strike, pressed the challenge as it was given, chiding him: “Child of my sister, none can match your strength, yes, but you’ve known neither failure nor resolve. When I strike, my foes know no rest.”\n\nUbatwir laughed, but Brave Mongoose, picking her moment, scurried forth and harried the towering upstart mid-gloat. Despite her foe’s overwhelming strength, Brave Mongoose robbed the titanic elephant of the initiative, knocking Ubatwir perpetually off balance from horizon to horizon. Teetering over the sea, Ubatwir panicked before falling into the endless water where he drowned, his towering body forming the Fallen Trunk Islands."

 desc_brave_mongoose_charismatic_major:0 "When the first beasts divided and diluted the Sky-Headed Beast’s essence through their descendants, Wise Leopard and Noble Elephant turned to squabbling over who should govern  Halann’s rivers. Each opened with arguments proposing how they deserved the mantle by deed and title, but when words failed and the Great Beasts readied claws and tusks, Brave Mongoose distracted her quarreling family via an absurd dance.\n\n”Siblings, behold my body’s incurvation: how I can dive swifter than a flood or slink like a meandering stream.” Wise Leopard and Noble Elephant erupted with laughter, diffusing their ire and granting Brave Mongoose her winning bid. ”It grieves me to witness this impassable contest. Yes, I lack your cunning or impartiality, but know, as I have ever known, that I love you both. Let me spare your pride and command the rivers in your steads.”\n\nSwayed by Brave Mongoose’s affection and charm, Wise Leopard and Noble Elephant agreed;  thus do all rivers wiggle and curve."
 brave_mongoose_prideful_major:0 "§OBrave Mongoose: The Prideful§!"
 desc_brave_mongoose_prideful_major:0 "While silently patrolling through the brush lands of her descendents, Brave Mongoose eavesdropped on a young huntress exaggerating her latest kill against a viper. “Surely,” she boasted to her fellows, “my great victory marks me worthy to receive Brave Mongoose’s blessing.”\n\nThe Great Beast, ever impudent, jumped out from hiding.\n\n“Ah, you are right, child of my children; I have not bested your ‘ferocious’ viper and her ‘daunting’ burrow. Perhaps her form slithered as long as the world-spanning Sky-Headed Beast (from whom I was first born)? Maybe her venom’s hate matched the Creator God’s ire (that I opposed...and won)? It could even be that the viper’s milk perfected bodily balance (which I cater in all who emulate my peerless qualities)?”\n\nAs the huntress deflated, Brave Mongoose saw growth in her heart, so she squealed wisdom into her ear: “Boasting is the second step after accomplishing. Now go forth, child of my children; I cannot wait to witness your future feats.”"
 brave_mongoose_ambitious_major:0 "§OBrave Mongoose: The Ambitious§!"
 desc_brave_mongoose_ambitious_major:0 "When rains poured so heavily that they quenched the silenced Plants of the Earth, Brave Mongoose searched the jungles for shelter. By her quivering nose, she smelled dry soil, and by her digging claws, she hollowed a tunnel fit for her length. Her children, sulking in soaking downpour, envied their progenitor’s talents and comfort.\n\n”What that we could rest with you, Brave Mongoose; Alas, your burrow cannot possibly hold us all.”\n\nBrave Mongoose’s gaze hardened at their despondency. “Children of my children, while wallowing in wetness, did you forget how to strive? I see a dream for us all, and I shall make it so!”\n\nThe Great Beast sprang to action, her scooping strikes descending into a whirlwind that rivaled the storm overhead. For three days she dug, and when she tired, Brave Mongoose beckoned her children to enter the greatest cavern yet known. And so for a generation, all beasts lived comfortably thanks to Brave Mongoose’s vigor."
 wise_leopard_cunning_major:0 "§OWise Leopard: The Cunning§!"
 desc_wise_leopard_cunning_major:0 "During a Rite of Passage, a young human wandered the forest floor, his dread deterring lesser guiding beasts and compelling Wise Leopard to intercede. Prowling above, the Great Beast beckoned: “Child of my children who seeks my strength; why do you fester with unease?”\n\nThe boy, tears welling, spoke from his heart. “My family are merchants, yet when I think of the trails I shall tread, my stomach spoils. To overcome my fear of new places, they have compelled me into the wilderness, but my mind wanders further than my feet.”\n\nWise Leopard, knowing the boy’s measure, conceived of a therapy to aid his student. “Your family has failed you, for the jungle is a deadly place. But—halt, did you hear that? A predator comes! Quickly, boy, up the tree! Lest your woes be seasoning!”\n\nDistractions shattered, the boy scampered through the understory and canopy, emerging into the sun-blessed tree tops. For handling his fear, Wise Leopard bit the boy’s nape and blessed him: “Fear paralyzed you, yet with a grounding motivator, you pressed on. Know your shortcomings so that you can weather doubt’s malevolence.”"

 desc_wise_leopard_avaricious_major:0 "While visiting his sister Brave Mongoose among the snow-kissed mountains, Wise Leopard marveled at the unearthed treasures of delicious worms and precious stones cluttering her newest lair.\n\n”Sister, you have invited me into your home, yet I have not yet eaten.”\n\n”My apologies, dear brother; Please, feast upon my succulent grubs.”\n\nWise Leopard grinned, eating his fill and thanking his sibling for her “unprompted” generosity. As he finished his meal, the siblings watched fresh snow shimmer in the quiet wind, chilling the burrow. With another scheme in mind, Wise Leopard shivered: “Brave Mongoose, the frost freezes my bones, for my fur is too short compared to your soft bulk. I think your sun-bright stones might warm me, but only if you cover each of my spots.” \n\nRuled by whim and impulse, Brave Mongoose showered her brother with precious gems without a second thought. Bidding goodbye to his treasured sibling and her clean abode, Wise Leopard skulked down from the mountain, fuller and richer than his ascent."

 desc_wise_leopard_calculating_major:0 "Trotting under a lonely savanna bough, the affable antelope Mzari, or Nice, failed to notice Wise Leopard, the stealthiest Great Beast, lurking above. Hungry for better meat, Wise Leopard pounced, pinning Mzari between his deadly fangs.\n\n”Wise Leopard,” the antelope rasped, “please, I am only searching for water for my kin. Spare me!”\n\nTeasing the killing bite, Wise Leopard ruminated on Mzari’s fate as informant or prey, saying, ”Child of my children; my pounce vanquished you. My tail wiggles in predatory delight. My eyes yearn to see your throat open and flowing. However...you are a paltry thing. What can you offer me, poor Mzari?”\n\nFrightened for his life, Mzari shared everything he knew of his kin with Wise Leopard, and, for betraying his fellow antelope, the Great Beast spared Mzari. He bade farewell with a lolling tongue, already aching to taste Mzari’s herd."

I am due the chance to stretch here. On this, I shall not budge!”\n\nNoble Elephant, upset by her brother’s unflinching demands, stomped and gored the ground and air, but Wise Leopard stared unphased. Escalating, the selfless Great Beast trumpeted, her nose blowing with the force of a hurricane, yet even as her brother’s ears bled, Wise Leopard’s slitted eyes kept to his prize, the hunter refusing to budge.”\n\n“Your feet tire and voice wanes. Continue as you dare, sister, but my claws are destined to knead this stone.”\n\nUnable to wear her brother down, Noble Elephant folded, and Wise Leopard rested upon the sun-drenched rock without contest. "

 desc_noble_elephant_loyal_major:0 "Sensing trouble in her bones, Noble Elephant scoured the plains before spotting a great host of animals pestering a young calf. Trumpeting with enough force to scatter the crowd, she approached the cowering elephant.\n\n“Child of my children, why do your kin harass you so?”\n\n“I am Yar (Small), daughter to Ubatwir (Authority), and with my father’s death, all who he terrorized now seek revenge against me. Please do not be angry with me.”\n\nWrapping her nurturing trunk around the young elephant, the Great Beast soothed her, saying, “Since the Great Creator’s tyrannical rule, I swore to be my descendents’ most ardent ally, for I am mother to all. You are not your father, and though my guidance could not sway his self-destructive acts, I nurtured him all the same...just as I do now to you. Know, Yar, you are beast, you are kin, and you are loved. By my vow, I will never deny you.”"

Each day, they would beseech her, saying, “Noble Elephant, we are frightened to move about, for predators and other dangers lurk everywhere.”\n\nThe Mother of All Beasts nodded, accepting to lead from the head, flank, rear, or wherever required her safeguarding gaze. Her progeny then whined of empty stomachs: “Noble Elephant, we cannot accumulate enough food for our children. Please assist us.”\n\nThe Mother of All Beasts nodded again, using her mighty trunk to pluck fruits from the highest branches. Tired, she laid down, but as she shut her eyes, the herd awoke their matron, begging, “we cannot stay alert as we rest; Can you watch us while we slumber?”\n\nRising, Noble Elephant kept watch until dawn, as she cherished her herd above her own needs."

Hungry, Brave Mongoose teased: “I shall despoil every crab hole and eel lair to enjoy the succulent meat within.”\n\nNot to be outdone, Wise Leopard mewled with tail on high, ”Well my claws will rake the ocean, casting all fish I catch into my maw.”\n\nBut Noble Elephant trumpeted, “We will do no such thing!”\n\n“Sister,” her siblings decried, “you would side with these lowly swimmers over us?”\n\nThe Mother of All Beasts sighed, gazing into the foaming waves at their feet. “When we claimed our dominions, none claimed the ocean for their own. These fathomless waters belong to our progeny: who are we to pilfer their dues?”\n\nBrave Mongoose and Wise Leopard capitulated, albeit after much groaning and gripping."

 desc_noble_elephant_protector_major:0 "Trudging through the savanna, the Three Great Beasts sweated and panted beneath the sun’s cruel light. “Look,” Wise Leopard said, “there is a watering hole. Let us rest there.”\n\nCollapsing on the shore, Brave Mongoose told her siblings, “I wish to have the first drink, for either of you will sully the water with your massive spit!”\n\nWise Leopard sneered, “Very well, but Noble Elephant, you cannot drink, for your mighty trunk will disturb the waters and ruin my chance to catch prey.”\n\nFar beyond her limit, Noble Elephant trumpeted, “All I have protected (even my own siblings) shun my dying thirst; woe to those I still love.”\n\nThunder clouded the horizon, and, within moments, the whole of beasts descended upon the watering hole. “Leave the Mother of All Beasts be,” the multitude commanded, “for she has given much. As she has protected, so too shall we protect her. Grant Noble Elephant her refreshing rest!”\n\nBrave Mongoose and Wise Leopard, cowed and shamed, retreated from the watering hole, and Noble Elephant took her fill."

 desc_brave_mongoose_bold_minor:0 "As the Great Creator smote the world for defying his design, the Three Great Beasts rallied the remaining beasts against utter destruction. Frothing, the Great Creator chided his creations: “TOO LONG HAVE I RULED WITH PATIENCE, BUT YOU MESH OF BEAST AND PLANT REWARD PATIENCE WITH REBELLION! HAVING SHIRKED MY WILL, I WILL CRUSH YOU AND BUILD ANEW! STRIKE AS YOU MAY, FOR I HAVE NEVER KNOWN HARM!”\n\nJoining her siblings’ rebukes, Brave Mongoose uttered, ”Tyrant, you think your hands are fit to squash us, the seeds blessed of both beasts and plants? My bite cannot match my sister’s tusks or brother’s claws in power, but I clamp past all defenses.”\n\nToo tall to perceive harm, the Great Creator lowered his hand to strike, but Brave Mongoose, often overlooked and underestimated, bit at his fingers, skirting the Great Creator’s divine aegis and impairing the almighty hands."

Confronted by their first great challenge as leaders, each of the Three Great Beasts courted the unruly zephyrs.\n\nBrave Mongoose, the most lovable of her siblings, asked the winds why they fumed with foul currents, and they replied, “The Plants of the Earth have been silenced, the beasts roam and eat freely, but where are we in this new world? Once guided by the Great Creator’s unyielding grip, we are now ignored, unseen, and unheard; so now we roar.”\n\nBrave Mongoose enjoined their struggles, sympathizing, “When I squeak, I am also ignored. The larger beasts, blinded by stature, do not know what it is to be like us. I cannot stop you from storming, but please, winds, mimic my vicious, shrill cries, for it would bring us both great company.”\n\nThe winds joined Brave Mongoose, becoming gentle breezes and fur-ruffling currents for the majority of the year."

What will you do to rectify my discomfort?”\n\nFinding herself absent of any wrongdoings, Noble Elephant merely covered the hole with her foot. “Impassioned as always, sister. Perhaps darkness will cool your anger.”\n\nDespite her union with the ground, Brave Mongoose flailed, indignant against her sister’s dominion. At first, Noble Elephant maintained her stance, but Brave Mongoose, knowing no cessation, nipped her foot, making her lose the will to maintain the prison. Noble Elephant removed her leg, and Brave Mongoose scurried free, puffing her chest and barring her teeth in victory."

Surely as the smallest, I will become full quickly, granting you both the choice parts you desire?”\n\nHonoring her ambition, the other siblings acquiesced to Brave Mongoose and allowed her to take the first fill, for who among the Great Beasts dares as fervently as Brave Mongoose dares?"

 desc_wise_leopard_cunning_minor:0 "As the Great Creator smote the world for defying his design, the Three Great Beasts rallied the remaining beasts against utter destruction. Frothing, the Great Creator chided his creations: “TOO LONG HAVE I RULED WITH KINDNESS, BUT YOU MESH OF BEAST AND PLANT REWARD KINDNESS WITH GREED! HAVING SHIRKED MY WILL, I WILL PLUCK THE PLANTS OF THE HEAVENS’ SOULS FROM THE SKY-HEADED BEAST FRAGMENTS YOU FOULED AND BURN THE REMAINS! SCHEME AS YOU MAY, FOR I KNOW ALL PLANS!”\n\nJoining his siblings’ rebuke, Wise Leopard roared, “Tyrant, you are old; as all progeny sees the world anew, your tricks and strategies are known to us. Now fling your wrath, for my claws ensnare every pulse of life, granting no error or escape.”\n\nToo stubborn to consider failure, the Great Creator channeled a torrent of divine might, but Wise Leopard, ever hidden, dropped from the clouds and seized the spell, snuffing the Great Creator’s weapon and rendering him surprised."

 desc_wise_leopard_avaricious_minor:0 "After a legendary hunt against the Plants of the Earth, the Three Great Beasts rested and exchanged tales of their harvests and kills for so long that their appetites swelled.\n\nBrave Mongoose, the most impulsive, spoke first. “Brother, sister; my tales on this hunt eclipse yours, as they always have. I shall feast upon every leaf, root, and tuber until I succumb to bloated slumber!”\n\nWise Elephant, largest of the three, staked her share. “Sister, brother, I churned the soil, and thanks to my tree-eclipsing trunk, we plucked the sweetest fruits.”\n\nWise Leopard, sucking in his gut and mewling pathetically, pretended to be positively famished. “Sisters, look at my drooping spots. We enacted righteous vengeance upon the traitorous Plants of the Earth, but they are robbed of thought and speech now, lacking that divine quality of flesh. Oh, how I long to satiate my carnivorous dues, yet I suppose these perennials must suffice.”\n\nTaken by their brother’s pitiful fib, Brave Mongoose and Noble Elephant begged Wise Leopard to eat first (a task he did greedily)."

 desc_wise_leopard_calculating_minor:0 "The winds, freed of divine command after the Great Creator’s demise, threatened to sweep the liberated beasts off the surface of Halann. Confronted by their first great challenge as leaders, the Three Great Beasts each courted the unruly zephyrs.\n\nMany animals tried catching the winds, but they proved too swift to snare. And so Wise Leopard, from his panoptic perch, studied the wind day after day: whence they arrived, how they moved as they badgered his kin, and where they retreated. Before he even readied a pounce, Wise Leopard devised his foe’s defeat.\n\nSeizing his opportunity, Wise Leopard descended upon the winds as they departed in vainglorious victory, catching them in his claws. “Unceasing winds, you are known to me now. I am Wise Leopard, and nothing can protect my prey, for my eyes see all and my fangs lurk behind every corner. Now cease your unruly patterns; I will not ask a second time.”\n\nWhipped, the winds vowed to flow with incremental consistency, never testing Wise Leopard’s threat."

 desc_wise_leopard_inflexible_minor:0 "After decapitating the Great Creator, the Three Great Beasts’ debated how to divide the world’s bounty between them and their progeny.\n\nWise Leopard lolled his tongue between his then-soft jaws: ”Sisters, we cannot take equal shares of the fallen Plants of the Earth. Rather than diversifying my diet, I shall heighten it, so that all predators can consume meat while leaving the Plants of the Earth to you both.”\n\n“Brother,” both siblings replied, “you would require deadly teeth to match this appetite: surely your claws are already enough?”\n\n”It is true that my claws robbed the Great Creator’s spell from his grasp, but to ensure a just kill for the children of our children, I need a bite to bring death and jowls to break apart the Sky-Headed Beast’s essence.”\n\nNoble Elephant, largest and selfless of the three, pledged only to eat whatever was leftover while the erratic Brave Mongoose swore to feast on whatever they could scrounge, be it plant or meat. And so the Three Great Beasts achieved their appetites."

Confronted by their first great challenge as leaders, the Three Great Beasts each courted the unruly zephyrs.\n\nSturdy as stone, Noble Elephant called out to the rebellious elements as they buffeted her: “Winds, why do you assault us beasts so?”\n\n”With the Great Creator’s demise, we are untethered, knowing no bond or trust. What else can we do but rage and storm?”\n\nThe Mother of All Beasts closed her eyes, sympathizing with their plight. “Imbued with the Plants of the Heavens, we beasts are myriad. For some, deadly attacks  or sly tricks can claim you, but know this, unceasing winds: I am Noble Elephant, and my word is all. If you would stay your gale, I will grant you purpose.”\n\nThe winds, moved by Noble Elephant’s virtue, halted their assault, and, true to her word, Noble Elephant guided the winds to imbue her mighty roar with a hurricane’s strength."

HAVING SHIRKED MY WILL, YOU AND YOUR PROGENY WILL VANISH FROM MY REALM! WEEP, BEASTS, FOR I SHALL ORDAIN NONE TO REMEMBER YOUR STRIFE-FILLED LIVES!”\n\nJoining her siblings’ rebukes, Noble Elephant trumpeted, “Even if I succumb to your wrath, my kin will live free, unbothered by your malevolence! This I pledge, for I can never die so long as my children thrive.”\n\nHer fear swallowed by loving sacrifice, Noble Elephant charged the Great Creator who, in his hubris, did not safeguard his monumental legs. The Mother of All Beasts shouldered horrific blows from his divine strikes, but, with burning purpose, she gored the Great Creator with her shining tusks, casting him prone."

Approaching, the Mother of All Beasts called to the young woman who, biting her tongue, spoke plainly: “How fate conspires to ruin my Rite of Passage. Noble Elephant, as part of my trials, I have been tasked to mediate between my younger siblings in their squabble over precious clothes. Despite the clear challenge, I do not know how to proceed: there are too many questions I have, and I am divided as they are both family. I can only lament my shortcomings.”\n\nNoble Elephant smiled, “All mothers wield power over dispute, but it must be cultivated first; Child of my children, you know what you do not know, and by your self-reflection, you have proven your merit. Now hasten to my side.”\n\nThe older girl did as commanded, and Noble Elephant instructed her in the ways of judgment and authority, blessing her Rite of Passage."

Defend yourself!”\n\nDespondent, Dahlo-bo meowed, ”Wise Leopard, who witnessed my birth and nurtured me through my childhood, has called me worthless, for my unretractable claws cannot climb and lanky form lacks the strength to ambush from above. Thus, I have laid down so that these carrion-feeders may pick at my bones and devour my sorrow.”\n\nHeart weeping and raging at her brother’s insensitivity, the Mother of All Beasts trumpeted, scattering the scavengers and beckoning, “Despair cowers before love and attention, Dahlo-bo; now, rise!”\n\nThe feline jumped to his paws, rallied by Noble Elephant’s call. The Great Beast pledged that, so long as he did not abate, she would support him. By her aid, Dahlo-bo honed his talents, becoming the first cheetah."
