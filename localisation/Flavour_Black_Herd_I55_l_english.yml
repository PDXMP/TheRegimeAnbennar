 I55_1_3_descend_title: "Descend"
 I55_1_3_descend_desc: "The Glutton King’s notes are a thing of beauty. Each scrap I read yields new insight into how Almokh sought to bind his soul to an object. Page after page, he catalogued his experiments on the nature of the tether between body and soul, and how that bond might be twisted, severed, or reforged.\n\nYet they remain incomplete. He was slain before his work could bear fruit, though he was so very close. I can see the shape of his design forming in my mind, and the vision it reveals is magnificent. Just a few more experiments should be enough to bridge the final gaps. I need only a suitable sacrifice.\n\nPerhaps my wife will serve. It is not as though our union will ever yield an heir, and this way she might still contribute to my legacy."
 I55_1_4_study_title: "Study"
 I55_1_4_study_desc: "Loethrklerd. A once prosperous kelaktar, the seat of the Glutton King, and the place of his undoing. Tens of thousands were sacrificed and reanimated within those walls, an empire of bone and hunger killed in its nascency. The ogres abandoned it to rot rather than deal with the undead that still shamble through its street, unchained from Almokh’s will by his death.\n\nFools. Their cowardice is my gain, as the ruins are practically untouched save for the ravages of time, its secrets left behind for me to plunder. The final legacy of the Glutton King will be mine, and I shall not squander it like he did. The skeletons must be cleared out, of course, but that is what warriors are for."

 I55_2_1_rediscovery_title: "Rediscovery"
 I55_2_1_rediscovery_desc: "When the Great Incursion swept into the valley of the ogres, it carried off more than our warriors. The elders, our greatest mages and the living memory of the Black Herd, galloped to their deaths, arcane secrets spilling out into the blood-soaked soil.\n\nWithout their knowledge our magic is hollow, and the few of us who remain, myself included, flounder without the centuries of experience from which the elders drew. The damage is immense, but I will not allow our craft to die like this. I have gathered what remains: scraps of parchment, embellished stories of rituals, the half-remembered stories of failed apprentices. Piece by piece, we will rebuild that which once defined us."
 I55_2_2_infiltration_title: "Infiltration"
 I55_2_2_infiltration_desc: "To prepare our warriors for another war against the ogres, I have been regaling them with tales of their brutish idiocy, insisting the first invasion failed only because of our disorder and weak commanders, and that under my strong leadership victory will come swiftly.\n\nOf course these stories are ludicrous, useful only to steel the ordsiwyns for battle. In truth, Ziltagh Gravelhide was a cunning and formidable foe, and assuming he will be any less in our second invasion would be folly. Thus the time has come for more underhanded methods, the kind at which the Caehns of the Great Incursion would have spat. I have instructed some of the herd’s mages to work hand-in-hand with our spies, sending invisible infiltrators to sow chaos and fracture the fragile unity Gravelhide has forged."
 I55_2_4_enshroud_title: "Enshroud"
 I55_2_4_enshroud_desc: "With the conquest of Maghargma, the heart of the ogre lands is ours at last. While my warriors waste their time terrorizing the surviving locals and reveling in food and drink, I have been scouring the royal archives. Centuries worth of scrolls and tomes line the walls, the sum total of ogre history and magic. The knowledge within will accelerate my plans by decades. Some of the oldest texts hint at an object of great necromantic power in the depths of Maghargma’s ancient ruins, a rumor that demands my personal investigation.\n\nThis archive truly is a beautiful thing. It is almost a shame what must be done to it. Once the most useful texts have been removed and secured in my baggage train, it must be put to the torch. The ogre’s secrets will remain mine alone for the rest of eternity. It would not do for some upstart to be able to use them against me, after all."
 I55_2_5_eclipse_title: "Eclipse"
 I55_2_5_eclipse_desc: "I am so close. Each day my research brings me nearer to the culmination of years of study. Every word in my tome is written in the blood of countless experiments. My understanding of the veil between life and death grows ever more complete, and soon I will hold true dominion over it.\n\nAlready I have mastered the raising and command of the undead. At my word, these legions shall march in perfect unison, no more squabbling clans or belligerent warriors, only my will made manifest.\n\nThere is but one step left to take: the binding of my own soul, after which I will be untethered from the constraints of mortality. As I look into the depths of the night sky I can see the shape of a new future, drenched in black and wrought from bone. And it is beautiful."

 I55_3_2_legacy_title: "Legacy"
 I55_3_2_legacy_desc: "Markhentakruan.\n\nIn the heyday of the Black Herd, the name of this spell was spoken with fearful reverence. After its casting the corpses littering the battlefield would shudder and swell before detonating violently, sending flaming viscera and bone flying and igniting anything that happened to survive the explosion itself. When the ringing in one's ears finally faded, all that could be heard were the screams of the dying mixed with the crackle of burning flesh, a grim chorus that haunted the dreams of rival Caehns.\n\nThis spell is our legacy, and I am ashamed to admit it is nearly lost to us. The fundamentals remain, the art of transmuting a corpse into an explosive still understood, yet the finer workings that elevate it from a mere mage’s parlor trick to a devastating weapon of war are missing.\n\nI have ordered the herd’s mages to devote themselves to its rediscovery. If we are to reclaim the glory of our name, Markhentakruan must be reclaimed."
 I55_3_3_retribution_title: "Retribution"
 I55_3_3_retribution_desc: "Years of preparation have led to this day. The ogres are in disarray, jumping at shadows in fear of our infiltrators. Our mages have reclaimed much of our craft and stand ready to test their spells in battle, staves painted black and bedecked in shaman-crafted icons of bone and damestear. The western clans stand united beneath my banner and hunger for vengeance.\n\nIt is time to return to the ogre land and avenge the pride Maghargma stole from us when they repelled out assaults. For every centaur they slew, every brother they stole from us, we will repay them tenfold and their precious valley will run red with their blood!"
 I55_3_4_subsume_title: "Subsume"
 I55_3_4_subsume_desc: "In the northernmost fringes of the valley dwell the last ogre practitioners of the necromantic arts. These shamans animate the bones of their prey once they have finished devouring the flesh, raising them as skeletal constructs that patrol the northern wilds and drag fresh victims back to their ever-hungry masters. It is a far more efficient system than I would have expected from such savages, but I suppose even a noseless dmarvuk finds food on occasion.\n\nMore intriguing still is how such large-scale arcane working can be sustained in these remote lands. A survey by one of my diviners has revealed that an immense deposit of damestear lies buried beneath the forest floor. Such a resource cannot be allowed to lie untapped, so I have subverted and repurposed the ogre’s undead. They’ll still patrol the wilds, but will now also begin extracting the damestear for my own purposes."
 I55_3_5_tearbloom_title: "Tearbloom"
 I55_3_5_tearbloom_desc: "While ogres are largely brutish creatures, worthless to the functioning of the caehnate, their mages are a fascinating exception. They are born with blue skin and pupiless blue-green eyes, a fascinating physiological difference, the provenance of which I have been unable to find despite several dissections.\n\nBeyond the physical differences, they also are far more cunning than a typical ogre, a quality I already prize in my own mages. I have gathered the surviving ogre spellcasters and intend to offer them a place in our hierarchy; the best among them will even be allowed to assist in my personal research. Magical talent is rare enough already; letting their power go unused would be a tremendous waste."
 I55_3_6_arise_title: "Arise"
 I55_3_6_arise_desc: "Irdaeos granted us the plains as both sanctuary and trial. Through hardship and endurance, we were to prove ourselves worthy of the paradise that lies beyond the veil. For generations, our people have honored his name in life, that they might join him in death. But few truly understand what that means, and none as deeply as I.\n\nSo I will wrench the veil open and reveal to them what awaits beyond. The dead will pour forth in an endless tide, sweeping across the plains. Before such power, the rest of Irdaeos’ chosen will have no choice but to acknowledge the Black Herd as the true masters of the steppes, restored to their former glory by my hand."
 I55_3_7_black_title: "Black"
 I55_3_7_black_desc: "I have seen the veil’s edge and felt its pull, beckoning me into its embrace. But that was not to be my fate. I have rejected the call of death and now stand undying, second only to Irdaeos himself.\n\nIrdaeos remains the final judge of entry into Ik Magthaal, yet it is by my hand that the dead are granted the chance to be judged. Those who honor him and his greatest servant upon Halann shall pass beyond, while those who defy us shall serve me in death until their debt is paid.\n\nI am his will made manifest, an ascendant star heralding a new night that will encompass the world."

 I55_4_1_nightfall_title: "Nightfall"
 I55_4_1_nightfall_desc: "To the other Caehns of the plains, there are two Black Herds. The first is the old Black Herd, greatest of the ghanzamh, wielders of dread magics that once sent the other clans fleeing in terror. To them, that Black Herd is dead. Though bringing it down required a grand coalition of the other clans, it was broken all the same.\n\nThe other Black Herd is ours, the few survivors of that coalition’s wrath, driven into exile on the western fringes of the plains. For decades we have endured, hiding on the edge of the steppe, ever fending off upstarts who seek us out and would see us finished. But that time is at an end.\n\nStarting today there shall be only one Black Herd, past and present feared as one. I am Caehn Baildelk II, and the world shall remember my name."
 I55_4_2_caehnship_title: "Caehnship"
 I55_4_2_caehnship_desc: "Our invasion of the Ogre Valley did not fail simply because our enemies were strong, but because our allies were weak. The lesser Caehns squabbled over plunder and glory while the ogres rallied. Centaur cowardice cost us our rightful victory.\n\nDisunity is a disease, one that has plagued us for generations. Egged on by emissaries from Wild Hunt, the coalition unified the clans in name only, a mistake I will not repeat. The western herds will be made to kneel beneath our banner, and no dissent shall be tolerated. Those who do not fall in line are to be dealt with swiftly and without mercy, until all that remains is a host united in purpose. With such a force behind me, I shall return to the valley and scour their lands with fire and sword"
 I55_4_3_reality_title: "Reality"
 I55_4_3_reality_desc: "The superiority of magic is beyond question. As mages, we wield the power to bend reality to our will, a strength that eclipses any blade or bow. Yet while this truth is self-evident, the herd’s mages remain lacking in practical experience.\n\nThey are all well-versed in the theory, having spent days practicing in the caverns of Danazgubli until the necessary incantations and gestures were second nature. But most of them have only tested their craft in spars against half-starved prisoners, never in true battle. So to the battlefield they must go. Only there, caked in the mud and blood of war, can they prove their might to both me and Irdaeos."
 I55_4_4_enthrall_title: "Enthrall"
 I55_4_4_enthrall_desc: "I have come to despise the clans. Their ceaseless bickering and pitiful demands for my attention have done nothing to help the Caehnate, only distracting from its true strength. More and more I have turned my back on those ignorant fools, choosing instead the company of my fellow mages, the only minds capable of glimpsing the herd’s glorious destiny.\n\nYet the clans still cling to their influence, whispering poison among the warriors and stirring unrest against my rule. I would sooner gouge out my own eye than give an inch to those insipid leeches. Still, dissent cannot be allowed to fester. One of my mages, a prodigy in the arts of enchantment, has offered a most elegant solution. If the clans cannot be reasoned with, their leaders shall be enthralled, ensuring their loyalty eternally. Let them protest. By dawn, they shall sing my praises. Preparations for the ritual have already begun."

 I55_5_2_theory_title: "Theory"
 I55_5_2_theory_desc: "If we are to recover our magical knowledge, a place to test our spells is required. Study and theory is critical, of course, but the messy work of iteration is quite destructive for the kinds of spells I intend to focus on, and it would be wasteful for any lives to be lost beyond those we intend. Distance from prying eyes is also essential; many of the lesser clans would doubtless find our research distasteful, though they will doubtless prove all too happy to reap the rewards new war magic will bring on the battlefield.\n\nThe great mountain at the edge of the Danazgubli wastes is exactly what I had in mind. Its vast caverns make for a perfect laboratory, where I can begin my experiments in earnest. "
 I55_5_5_compound_title: "Compound"
 I55_5_5_compound_desc: "We have reclaimed the lost knowledge of our forebears. Markhentakruan lives again; under its thrall, the corpses of the field bloom like wildflowers after spring’s first rainstorm, blossoming in blood, bone, and flame. The sight’s terrible beauty is evident to all who bear witness to it. Yet every time I cast it, I am left unsatisfied. I can see the imperfections, small cracks in the spellwork marring its power.\n\nEvery piece of evidence indicates that this is indeed the Markhentakruan of old, but it is still lacking something. Perhaps it is simply the fact that I have surpassed the elders who first created it. Oh, they were geniuses for their time, of course – creating a spell as powerful as this from whole cloth is a vicious process. But they lacked the depth of understanding and mastery that I hold. There is still more to be done with Markhentakruan, refinements to be made and new applications to uncover."

 #Events
 black_herd_events.0.t: "The Last Shamans"
 black_herd_events.0.desc: "It's the end of an era for the centaur tribes. The Filustkhuga and Maslekhuga sects led the packs into the incursion against the ogres, an event that we took part in while hoping to gain new lore, knowledge, and all the loot we could carry. \n\nWe were wrong.\n\nThough the initial conflicts were a success for us, the other tribes grew too greedy and hastily attempted to move ahead, resulting in the recently crowned ogre king destroying them in battle and ending any chance of us gaining anything in their realm. Our tribesmen barely escaped the ensuing chaos, with many of the mages in our ranks sacrificing themselves in battle, so that the majority of the Black Herd could escape back into the plains.\n\nWhen the Wild Hunt called for a similar incursion into the Lake Federation, some of our ranks ran east to join, and, to our knowledge, died a worthless death in a fool's war. The others, however, hid deep in the westernmost plains and bided their time, waiting for the inevitable collapse of the Wild Hunt. Our prediction came true around three years ago, and we now have gained control over a small piece of territory and re-established our fallen clan. Led by one of the last remaining mages and only remaining heir to the title of storm king in our ranks, Baildelk II, we may never get another opportunity like this again. By Irdaeos’s blessing, we will survive!"
 black_herd_events.0.a: "By Irdaeos' will, Baildelk will lead us to our destiny!"

 black_herd_events.1.t: "Leaflets of The Glutton King"
 black_herd_events.1.desc: "The heated arguments of the war council fall silent as someone bursts into my tent, heads snapping from the maps to the intruder. I rise from my rug, ready to demand an explanation, but pause, recognizing the kneeling centaur as one of the infiltrators I sent into the ogres’ heartlands. Curiously, he clutches a bundle of ancient parchment.\n\n“Ten thousand apologies for disturbing you, my Caehn,” he begins, lowering his gaze. “But this discovery could not wait. We were told to watch for any magical knowledge, and in a vault I was… exploring, I found a set of notes penned by an ogre necromancer known as the Glutton King.”\n\nWith a snap of my fingers, the parchments are brought to me. I unfold them carefully, scanning the cramped script and fragmented diagrams. The pages speak of a single obsession: the conquest of Death itself, achieved by binding one’s soul to an object.\n\nA wave of the hand dismisses the council. Alone, I study the fragments in silence. They are incomplete, yet ingenious. The author – Almokh, as he names himself – was close to unlocking true immortality. The idea stirs something within me. For all my power, I will never have an heir to carry my name. But perhaps I do not need one. Why should I pass my legacy to another, when I could endure forever?\n\nI reach for fresh parchment and begin the painstaking task of transcribing Almokh’s work away from the decaying leaflets."
 black_herd_events.1.a: "What an intriguing idea… have the spies hunt for more such papers"

 black_herd_events.2.t: "Cauterizing History"
 black_herd_events.2.desc: "The camp lies silent tonight. For weeks I have labored with the other mages, poring over every scrap of knowledge about Markhentakruan we could assemble. I have listened to dozens of stories and read endless pages of theories. Now the time has come to assemble everything we have learned.\n\nIt feels right, holding the elders’ knowledge in my hands. So much was lost to the folly of the Great Incursion, and yet piece by piece I have begun to rebuild it. The others watch me from the edges of the cleared circle, their eyes bright with fear and reverence alike. Wordlessly I set the notes aside and begin the incantation. The air grows heavy. For the first time in years, the magic of the Black Herd breathes again. Heat fills the air as the flesh of the freshly hunted almruk begins to bubble and hiss. \n\nThen, all at once, the spell is broken. The corpse bursts with a sad wet pop, its fluids oozing into the soil. This was certainly not the devastating detonation that made the spell so feared, but a useful first step nonetheless. The spell successfully bound itself to the corpse without affecting the surroundings, and the corpse did begin to transmute, just not explosively. We must return to our studies and determine what went wrong."
 black_herd_events.2.a: "This is but the first step of many "

 black_herd_events.3.t: "Emblazing The Deep"
 black_herd_events.3.desc: "The caverns of Danazgubli are the perfect crucible for my work. Down here, in the choking dark, no prying eyes interrupt and no screams carry beyond the stone. The air is heavy with power, the residue of a hundred spells seeping into the rock. Today has been a day of focus and repetition, refining my magic bit by bit.\n\nTime is elusive in these depths. With no sun or stars, judging the passing hours is nigh impossible. Yet I know the day nears its end, for at the edge of the torchlight only a few ogres remain. They sit chained, silent, and resigned after watching their fellows reduced to heaps of charred bone. There are enough left for one final casting.\n\nMy assistants drag the brutes into the field of ash and bone before retreating, lest they be caught in the spell. With a word the flickering darkness erupts into fire and screams, tongues of flame rushing across the cavern floor, eager to consume the prisoners. I watch as they burn, counting under my breath while I fill yet another parchment with notes, documenting every detail. When the last ogre collapses unmoving, I stop my count and mark the final line upon the page. That was the last of the prisoners, yet I still have strength aplenty to continue."
 black_herd_events.3.a: "That is sufficient for now."
 black_herd_events.3.b: "Send for more prisoners, I am close to a breakthrough."

 black_herd_events.4.t: "Ashen Past"
 black_herd_events.4.desc: "The creature screams as my lightning courses though its body, its rotted limbs convulsing as a horrible scratchy hiss escapes from its jawless mouths. Then it stops, twitching one last time before falling still. It is a fascinating being, two bodies fused unnaturally, seven limbs scuttling on the ground while one grasps blindly toward the ceiling. The sight sets my mind alight with ideas for the future; I itch to pull parchment from my saddlebags and sketch precisely how the second head is fused into the torso. But the ruins of Maghargma are no place for idle fancies. The deeper I go, the more such creatures I encounter.\n\nDigging deeper into the rumors of undead prowling the depths of Maghargma led me to tales of Waeruk Magerender, the slayer of the Glutton King. It is said he returned from Loethrklerd carrying several of the Glutton King’s artifacts and sealed them deep within these ruins, fearing that destroying them would unleash the power within. A reasonable fear. As I work my way through the crumbling tunnels, I can feel the artifact calling out to me, a beacon drawing me ever closer.\n\nThe emanating necromantic energy has long saturated these halls, raising the corpses of those foolish enough to venture this deep. Only after cutting down a dozen such creatures do I reach a vast pair of iron doors, sealed with a massive bar of stone, movable only by the strength of several ogres. A single spell shatters the barrier and the doors open for the first time in centuries .Within, chained to a dais, rests a small black bottle carved from an ancient bone. I free it from its bindings and lift it high, the energy within roiling, whispering promises of a future black as night. Almokh had come far closer to his goal than any realized, and his loss shall be my gain."
 black_herd_events.4.a: "The first step of my ascension is secured."

 black_herd_events.5.t: "Starlight"
 black_herd_events.5.desc: "The plains are quiet tonight. No wind, no cries of beasts, only the faint whisper of grass beneath my hooves. For once, there is peace. I look up, and the sky looks back, endless, cold, and clear.\n\nToo many spend their lives trying to fight the night, fearing what they cannot see. But I have long since embraced it, surrendering my very flesh. They do not understand what the darkness brings. It is not terror. It is not despair. It is stillness. It is beauty. The light of the stars shines only because of the dark that surrounds them. I am at home here.\n\nI see in those distant lights the reflection of my own work, the world reborn, pure and quiet beneath my rule. Death and silence, order and grace. The night is my gift to the living, and the starlight above, my mirror. So few recognize this truth, recoiling at the future I offer. But they will learn. One by one they shall fall to me, and in the darkness that follows, the world will be remade."
 black_herd_events.5.a: "I shall be the shepherd of this coming night"
 black_herd_events.5.b: "I shall sweep the world clean and rebuild it in my image"
 black_herd_events.5.c: "I shall make them understand, one way or another"

 black_herd_events.10.t: "Illuminating Shadows"
 black_herd_events.10.desc: "Markhentakruan Restoration Notes - [GetDate]\n\nAfter our first failed cast we have returned to the drawing board. Clearly we lacked an adequate understanding of the transmutation mechanism. So it is back to gathering information. Asking only clan members with magical talent provided an incomplete picture, so I have expanded the scope and ordered every member of the clan old enough to have witnessed the spell or spoken to its casters to give an account.\n\nMost of their recountings are obviously of little worth, but some have already given us new trails to follow. The older warriors especially passed on valuable insights - how the elders cast the spell during the heat of battle, what the affected corpses looked like moments before its violent conclusion.\n\nThe problem stymying our progress is that with so many points of data, it is proving difficult to assemble them into a cohesive whole. For every set of accounts that seem to agree on a characteristic, there is another set that gives a completely different conclusion. We simply lack any hard evidence to determine which are the truth. The only option remaining is to begin working our way through the different permutations and eliminate the false leads one by one. I am not looking forward to it. "
 black_herd_events.10.a: "This will keep us busy for a long time"

 black_herd_events.11.t: "Lighting The Path"
 black_herd_events.11.desc: "Markhentakruan Restoration Notes - [GetDate]\n\nI write this note several days' travel from the main camp. A few weeks ago one of my assistants had the idea that we might find physical evidence from Markhentakruan at a battlefield where it was once cast. I was sceptical’; the chaos of battles, the deluges of rain, and the simple passage of time all seemed certain to have erased any trace. But after months of fruitless attempts to reassemble the spell from oral testimony, I was willing to try anything. I dispatched several scouts to search known sites where the spell was cast and to my astonishment one of them actually found something.\n\nHe discovered fragments of a charred ogre skeleton half-buried in the dry earth. We set out immediately and arrived last night, beginning our excavations at first light. As the dirt was cleared we found more fragments of bone, just enough to roughly reassemble the skeleton and gain a picture of what occurred. The findings were revelatory. Most of the bones surrounding the abdomen were entirely missing, likely pulverized by the force of the detonation. The closest surviving bones, including some of the vertebrae and the collarbone, were shattered into numerous splinters. The extremities were more intact, scattered far from what we believe was the epicenter.\n\nFrom this, I have concluded that the corpse was not transmuted in its entirety, as we once believed. Instead the explosive is formed in the center of the body and sends limbs and chunks of corpse flying outward with tremendous force upon detonation. The even charring on the remaining bones suggests that an intense burst of heat and flame preceded the blast, which is likely the catalyst that triggered it"
 black_herd_events.11.a: "At last some concrete evidence"

 black_herd_events.12.t: "History Ignites"
 black_herd_events.12.desc: "Markhentakruan Restoration Notes - [GetDate]\n\nSuccess at last! The corpse gave a whip crack, rupturing at the flesh; then all was noise, an indescribable crash that rolled through the camp like the roar of Irdaeos himself, descending to tear the world asunder. The air shook - for a heartbeat I felt my bones follow suit. The sound still echoes in my ears, dwelling faintly at the edge of the edge of thought, a constant reminder of the power I now command.\n\nWe had tested it using rodents beforehand, of course. I am not so foolish as to demonstrate before the clan without verifying it works ahead of time. Still, a fully grown bo may have been an excessive choice for the first true casting, as the size of the explosion does seem to grow with the target. The corpse shifted as I cast, its innards reshaped by the transmutation, before the second half of the spell lit the body aflame. A few heartbeats later came the detonation, a glorious and deafening display that sprayed gore across the empty field.\n\nI am sorely tempted to stay in my tent and keep working and improving the spell, even after demonstrating it successfully. There are clear signs that this was an inferior version compared to the Markhentakruan of old. Compared to the remains we found the blast was more contained, the explosion simply lacking the same force it once had. Furthermore, the fragments failed to remain aflame after being hurled through the air, leaving the bones uncharred unlike the ones we uncovered.\n\nPerhaps this is simply perfectionism. Markhentakruan has, without question, been restored. Regardless, a grand celebration has already begun and rumors will spread among the warriors if I fail to attend. I suppose I will have to return to this work at a later time."

 black_herd_events.20.t: "Stoke The Flame"
 black_herd_events.20.desc: "Markhentakruan Restoration Notes - [GetDate]\n\nAt long last, I have returned to working on Markhentakruan. Since its rediscovery we have brought the spell to bear in battle numerous times. It has proven quite effective, yet it still lacks the overwhelming impact it once possessed. Markhentakruan used to herald the end of the battle the moment it was cast, a ferocious thunderclap followed by screams and the chaotic scrambling of a rout.\n\nI have reconvened the mages to address this shortcoming, much to the dismay of the warrior clans who complain endlessly that I have less time to waste listening to their bleating. Together, we have identified a key area for improvement: the flames used to detonate the corpses. They succeed in triggering the ignition but fail to remain alight or spread once the spell concludes. From both warriors’ accounts and the unearthed remains, we know the flames once persisted long after the detonation. As such, our task is to restore that lost effect.\n\nSince the first successful casting, my understanding of evocation magic has deepened considerably. Integrating that new knowledge will be an excellent starting point."
 black_herd_events.20.a: "Have mages be ready to test new iterations in battle as they are made"

 black_herd_events.21.t: "Spread The Blaze"
 black_herd_events.21.desc: "Markhentakruan Restoration Notes - [GetDate]\n\nImprovements to Markhentakruan are coming from two main sources. The first of these concerns is the persistence of the corpse-flame after detonation. I was inspired by the flaming munitions spell, a staple of war mages across the plains. The spell binds the fire to the munition, allowing fragments to fly through the air without interruption or diminishment of the flame. I have adapted the ignition component of Markhentakruan to use this framework, greatly improving the durability of the flames.\n\nThe second breakthrough has come from one of my transmutation mages. He discovered a method to transmute the skin of a corpse into what he calls a ‘voracious resin,’ a substance that has some truly fascinating properties. Upon ignition, the resin breaks down into a sticky, viscous liquid that burns with an intense flame. When this spell is cast as a precursor to Markhentakruan, the explosion scatters the burning resin indiscriminately, clinging to everything it touches and setting it ablaze. Attempts to scrape or shake it off only serve to spread the blaze further.\n\nFuture tests will need to be conducted from further away. One of my mages has already suffered extensive burns across his flank after standing too close to the blast. The necessary transmutation is quite complex, but if we can integrate it into Markhentakruan the results should be immediate and devastating."
 black_herd_events.21.a: "We should test the efficacy of this ‘voracious resin’ on our enemies "

 black_herd_events.22.t: "Raise The Inferno"
 black_herd_events.22.desc: "Markhentakruan Restoration Notes - [GetDate]\n\nI am now comfortable stating that our Markhentakruan is a worthy recreation of the original spell. Early trials in battle have proven the efficacy of the voracious resin beyond any doubt. The sight of the fire racing through the enemy lines, panic spreading even faster than the flames in the wake of each corpse's detonation, is a memory I will treasure forever.\n\nThe voracious resin held. The bound flames survived the blast. Where our earlier variants merely shocked and killed, now the spell consumes the enemy ranks like a wildfire ripping its way across the steppe, more a force of nature than a mortal creation. In that moment, watching the carnage grow into a rout, I knew that I held the power of the old Black Herd in my hands.\n\nWith this power we stand renewed, once again poised to be the terror that once dominated these steppes. Our legacy has reconnected with our present, the broken links of the last century reforged by my will."

 black_herd_events.30.desc: "Markhentakruan Restoration Notes - [GetDate]\n\nWe have brought Markhentakruan back to the strength it once held in the days of the elders. Its thunder shakes the plains, its fire devours all it touches, and the enemies of the Black Herd flee before it. But I am not satisfied with simply matching the strength of our precursors. The simple truth is that I have already surpassed them as a mage, and am not content to simply sit idle on that title like some fat ogre mengur’m. It would be negligent of me to leave our signature magic unrefined.\n\nThe quandary I face is deciding what needs to be done to improve the spell. There are of course a half dozen minor adjustments I intend to make, tweaks to improve efficiency and make the spell easier to cast, but that is mere busywork. I am searching for a grander improvement that will cause my version of Markhentakruan to eclipse that of the past. The voracious resin seems to have reached the peak of its potential, so I have turned my attention to the core of the spell: the explosive transmutation. Enhancing the potency of the detonation should not only improve both the initial lethality but also amplify the spread of the flames."

 black_herd_events.31.t: "Shattering Stone"
 black_herd_events.31.desc: "Markhentakruan Improvement Notes - [GetDate]\n\nSimply increasing the size of the explosion has proven problematic. Enlarging the scale of the transmutation before detonation does produce a greater blast with improved lethality, but it also greatly diminishes the spread of the flames, a trade not worth such meager gains. I was at an impasse until a mage in Danazgubli made a catastrophic error. He had piled several corpses against the cavern wall before casting the amplified version of the spell, triggering a cave collapse that killed him and two apprentices instantly. Despite the waste of resources the incident has inspired me. What if, instead of merely breaking armies, Markhentakruan could break walls?\n\nThe simplest approach would be to use the enhanced variant as a dedicated siege spell, but that would not be an improvement, only another tool in our arsenal. I want this wallbreaking capability woven directly into the spell’s framework.\n\nMy solution is an elegant one. The force of the explosion already scales with the size of the corpse, and testing has shown the relationship to be nonlinear, with larger bodies yielding disproportionately greater power. If I add a component that fuses nearby corpses into a single amalgam before transmutation, the spell will retain its normal properties in battle while gaining the strength to shatter walls, provided we take the time to pile the dead high enough."

 black_herd_events.32.t: "Markhentakruan"
 black_herd_events.32.desc: "Markhentakruan Improvement Notes - Final Entry - [GetDate]\n\nThe culmination of years of research has completed its final trial. Every refinement, every failure, every scrap of lost wisdom reclaimed from the ashes of the past has led to this. Markhentakruan has reached its final form, merely restored but improved, sculpted by my power to possess a new strength surpassing the Black Herd of old.\n\nTo test the final iteration of the spell, I traveled to one of the smaller kelaktars within my domain. My warriors brought forth a thousand ogres from within its walls, and once they had been slain, their bodies were arranged in several great piles along the outer wall. As I cast the spell, the corpses began to warp and melt like beeswax beneath the sun, their bodies running together until it was impossible to tell where one ogre ended and another began, each mound a mass of contiguous flesh studded with jutting limbs and half-formed faces. It was a beautiful sight, worthless lives transformed by death into fuel for my magic.\n\nThen, in an instant, it was gone. The blast struck like a falling star, the sound and shockwave leaving us deaf and reeling even from a great distance. When the dust finally settled, I approached to find that the wall had been annihilated, the rubble hurled into the town, leaving the surrounding structures as shattered as the fortifications.\n\nI can see it now: ten thousand dead lake humans piled high against their own walls, their cities burning as the Black Herd rides through the breach. This will be the pinnacle of Markhentakruan, the weapon that will secure the greatest victory in centaur history. It is ready. It is perfect."
