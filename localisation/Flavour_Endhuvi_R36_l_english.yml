 R36_sentinels_of_the_river_title:0 "Sentinels of the River"
 R36_sentinels_of_the_river_desc:0 "As one of the few major river crossings south of Tughayasa, we have stood watch over the river dutifully in service to the Raja. Our people know better than any how best to defend our land; it is only right that we allow the local nobility the freedom to organize their warriors as they see fit. Our neighbors lack the same discipline and for the safety of the Raj as a whole, we have no choice but to administer their lands ourselves."

 R36_a_true_guardian_of_the_river_title:0 "Guardian of the River"
 R36_a_true_guardian_of_the_river_desc:0 "Our control of the western bank grows; our forts stand proud with their levies at the ready. Gaining control over the Porcelain cities has brought with it security for the artisans who create porcelain masterpieces and safe ports for traders and visitors who travel up and down the great river. It stands to us now to be worthy of such prestige and strength, that we can further guard the border against any would-be foes."

 R36_a_porcelain_secret_title:0 "A Porcelain Secret"
 R36_a_porcelain_secret_desc:0 "The porcelain trade has brought immense wealth to those cities along the Kharunyana which specialize in its craft. Tightly guarded workshops with the artisans who ply their trade are nestled amongst warehouses and homes. Works of art, practical and otherwise emerge from these compounds, to be whisked off by barge to the rich and powerful. The craftsmen and women are tightly controlled by the trade princes as each is worth a fortune in their own right. Those who retire from their position train the next generator under strict secrecy. None of the artisans are allowed out of the workshops without a guard, so jealously protected are their secrets. The guards hired by each prince are renowned for their discretion and skills at ensuring that the secret never leaves the cities. We can leave the defense of the cities in their hands, knowing their determination to protect their secrets as much as the land itself."

 R36_friends_abroad_title:0 "Friends Abroad"
 R36_friends_abroad_desc:0 "Most inside the Raj are too focused on their own selfish advancement to worry about the health of the nation as a whole. As our views broaden thanks to the influx of new ideas brought by the Kharunyana's trade and the Society, we must seek those who can aid us without such petty aspirations. To that end, we must ensure we have reliable allies outside of the Raj whom we can both rely on, and they us. Such diplomatic overtures will ensure we are well positioned and protected both from without and within."

 R36_securing_materials_title:0 "Securing Materials"
 R36_securing_materials_desc:0 "The growing trade along the river and needs of our communities have overtaken our shipbuilders. It would do us well to acquire and build up a greater supply of timber. The jungles between the Kharunyana and the plains would be ideal locations for new lumber camps. This would allow us to improve and innovate on our riverboat designs and increase our influence on the Kharunyana still further."

 R36_new_barges_title:0 "New Barges"
 R36_new_barges_desc:0 "The Cinnabar Lotus Society continues to grow. Even the expanded  debate hall on the river has begun to feel cramped. In order to further facilitate their expansion we should invest in another raft of barges to allow yet more buildings to be added onto its floating campus."

 R36_ill_make_a_friend_title:0 "I'll Make a Friend"
 R36_ill_make_a_friend_desc:0 "The longer something has gone on, the harder it is to stop. However, by ensuring that foes from within have been placated, we can further focus our efforts to see through rapprochement with Parusad Bhola  and strengthen us both. The influence of the Senapti's queen have steadily steered minds towards a more open view of the role of women in our society. The princesses of the Ruby Garden have proven receptive to our overtures and we must make good our commitment to peace and new outlook. Let us strengthen our new alliance with action and ensure their interests are looked after as well as our own."

 R36_knowledge_of_a_different_sort_title:0 "Knowledge of a Different Sort"
 R36_knowledge_of_a_different_sort_desc:0 "It's one thing to know how the physical world works; quite another to understand magic. A healthy debate can change many minds, but spells cannot be argued with. Enchanted porcelain masterpieces, animated and floating atop pedestals, wards of calming on embassies that soothe angry minds, channeling the waters of the river itself to wash away foes or erode fortifications and foundations are all new applications of magic for us. It would behoove us to ensure our state mages are as skilled as advisors as the rest of the court."

 R36_looking_to_the_eastern_bank_title:0 "Looking to the Eastern Bank"
 R36_looking_to_the_eastern_bank_desc:0 "In our efforts to bring stability to the western border of our lands, we have brought Sarisung into the fold and our reach creeps across the banks of the Kharunyana. A river is both its banks, and so must its people be as well; for those who live beside it know a river best."

 R36_growing_our_reach_title:0 "Growing Our Reach"
 R36_growing_our_reach_desc:0 "Long have most of us looked down on the lower castes, often for good reason. The value of our fortresses and the land they sit on cannot be overstated. As our reach on the opposite bank and the foothills of Thadarsaghol grows, we must remain loyal and our troops at the ready."

 R36_the_elephant_lords_title:0 "The Elephant Lords"
 R36_the_elephant_lords_desc:0 "A steadfast ally has the Elephant Lords been since we first agreed to cooperate. The lessons learned from their advisors have improved the state of our military and they have aided us in numerous battles.  We must demonstrate that trust is not unfounded and prove our strength by our own fang and claw."

 R36_a_healthy_body_is_a_healthy_mind_title:0 "Healthy Body, Healthy Mind"
 R36_a_healthy_body_is_a_healthy_mind_desc:0 "Trade along the Kharunyana is the lifeblood of our nation, as is the river itself. The branches of the river are many, heavy with the fruits of the Porcelain cities. The constant movement has fostered new ideas and the idea that one's station may change as easily as the river weaves through the landscape."

 R36_rebuilding_burned_bridges_title:0 "Rebuilding Burned Bridges"
 R36_rebuilding_burned_bridges_desc:0 "Our conflict with Parusad Bhola goes back centuries, since the dissolution of the first Phoenix Empire. Following its collapse, we battled with Parusad Bhola numerous times over the Maharaaja plains. In 1169 we struck at their capital and were turned back. Since then, each time one of us has gained the upper hand, the Raja has intervened, seemingly to preserve our relative weakness and prevent the emergence of a united threat. In that time, over 300 years, the conflict has gone nowhere, a stalemate. As the new heir and his mother join our ranks with new ideas and ambitions, it is high time we set aside the sword, and let the pen have its day. We will make overtures to the Raja and to Parusad Bhola, for this fighting serves to weaken the realm as a whole."

 R36_a_philosopher_king_title:0 "A Philosopher King"
 R36_a_philosopher_king_desc:0 "New ideas brought by the Cinnabar Lotus Society, alongside the growth in our trade and influence along the Kharunyana, have upset many of our rivals in Raj and at home. However none can deny the prosperity our realm enjoys thanks to all this. Instead of opposing such changes, however, our new heir has decided to flow with the course of the river. A well placed word, after all, can change the course of history. Our ruler must be informed and skilled in all matters; by inviting the masters of the Society to tutor and challenge them, they can prove their abilities and strengthen their weaknesses at matters of state."

 R36_the_first_ruby_garden_debate_title:0 "The 1st Ruby Garden Debate"
 R36_the_first_ruby_garden_debate_desc:0 "The stage is set; the players have agreed to formal diplomatic talks. The Ruby Gardens of Parusad Bola will be host to the three delegations. Our Senapti, our most skilled diplomats and philosophers, will go in our name, for we hope at long last to bury the hatchet with our neighbors and enter a period of peace and prosperity."

 R36_taking_the_grand_city_title:0 "Taking the Grand City"
 R36_taking_the_grand_city_desc:0 "Sarisung is at the heart of Haless and is the largest of the Porcelain cities. The true embodiment of the river and its people. A tarnished and scarred gem against the shining waters of the Kharunyana. It's people need not fear those who protect them, but instead flourish beneath their rule. The gangs who control it have brought not but discord and strife to its streets. As protector of the great river, we should bring it into the fold."

 R36_the_rotting_heart_of_haless_title:0 "The Rotting Heart of Haless"
 R36_the_rotting_heart_of_haless_desc:0 "We have taken the great city, but it is a husk of its former self. If it is to be a jewel in the river once more, we must bring order to its streets and stability to its people. Vast talent resides amongst the populace, much of it suppressed or exploited by the gangs. We should cultivate these individuals, rebuild the city's infrastructure and unify its purpose with a central rule. None have tamed the heart of the river, but this river is ours and we must be the first."

 R36_the_second_ruby_garden_debate_title:0 "The 2nd Ruby Garden Debate"
 R36_the_second_ruby_garden_debate_desc:0 "The time has come: we have nurtured our allies, grown in strength, too much so to be contained by the stagnant and backwards politics of the Raj. We must call another debate from a position of equality, flanked by all those who stand at our side. It is time to leave the Raj; a formal marriage between our Senapti and the princesses of the Ruby Garden would cement our bond as we strike out on our own."

 R36_a_pivot_title:0 "A Pivot?"
 R36_a_pivot_desc:0 "Free at last from the Raja's grip, we stand now alongside our friends and allies, our necks unbent. The Kharunyana flows once more, the silt it brings flecked in saffron and gold. We must decide if we should take up the banner of the old Great Dhujat, restoring the fallen kingdom to glory, or continue down the path that we have started and embrace the presence of the Kharunyana among us."

 R36_formal_debate_teams_title:0 "Formal Debate Teams"
 R36_formal_debate_teams_desc:0 "The Cinnabar Lotus Society started as a mere tea house meeting between six young philosophers. So passionate were their debates that word soon spread to the Senapti and the educated court milieu. It is clear that such rhetorical energies should be channeled, not stifled. Endhuvi is ever in need of bright minds, and formally recognizing the Society would be a boost to their prestige and the states as a whole. In addition, a delegation should be sent to the Hall of Endless Debate, to debate the masters and sages who reside there and bring their ideas back to Endhuvi."

 R36_a_matter_of_debate_title:0 "A Matter of Debate"
 R36_a_matter_of_debate_desc:0 "When he first passed through Endhuvi, Guru Suhan's ideas found little purchase amongst the people at large. Amongst the philosophers of the Society, however, they found his views to be quite agreeable. As admission into the Society has long been built on merit and debate, the idea that none have the right answer and all views must be considered has long since been a founding principal. Now that his Praxis has emerged, we should bring this before our liege."

 R36_growing_the_society_title:0 "Growing the Society"
 R36_growing_the_society_desc:0 "The Society has grown enough that the old meeting hall on the bank of the river is no longer suitable. One bright spark had the suggestion that we expand onto the river; after all, its free real estate. We could even float a new debate hall to the site. It would be the largest barge ever to float down the Kharunyana and its creation a masterwork in of itself."

 R36_the_porcelain_artery_title:0 "The Porcelain Artery"
 R36_the_porcelain_artery_desc:0 "The Kharunyana links the great Porcelain Cities, and down its length trade ships sail, laden with great works of our artisans. The skills of our middle caste do not go unnoticed, and neither they nor our (ruler title) wish to see their secrets slip away."

 R36_the_river_slows_title:0 "The River Slows"
 R36_the_river_slows_desc:0 "As a river grows broad and deep, so too does its pace begin to slow. This doesn't make it any less dangerous..."

 R36_a_spiritual_and_magical_advisor_title:0 "Esoteric Advice"
 R36_a_spiritual_and_magical_advisor_desc:0 "The gradual stopping of the flow of the Kharunyana defies even the most learned scientists and scholars in our nation. We must explore yet further ideas and options if we are to solve this. Mages, priests, monks, any may weigh in during this time of crisis."

 R36_a_question_of_spirits_title:0 "A Question of Spirits"
 R36_a_question_of_spirits_desc:0 "We have gathered all possible explanations from every source we could think of in our efforts to restore our river. Our Mystic Accord friends have suggested that the great spirit of the Kharunyana is the cause of the malaise. This is hotly contested by our mages and the philosophers amongst our court; we must settle this as only Endhuvi can, by debate."

 R36_a_friendly_fish_title:0 "A Friendly Fish"
 R36_a_friendly_fish_desc:0 "The idea that the river itself is a great spirit has taken deep root, the longer we debate this crisis. What's more, the inundating of the temple has finished and the river flows into its halls. Schools of catfish have been seen swimming through the halls of the now flooded temple: a sign? An omen?"

 R36_friends_in_the_north_title:0 "Friends in the North"
 R36_friends_in_the_north_desc:0 "Long have we bordered the broad plains of the Elephant Lords to our north. The thunder of their mighty cavalry has shook the earth on more than one occasion, threatening the very walls of our city. As we strive to connect with our neighbors, it would behoove us to ensure we are on good terms with these great lords. Their skill with their elephants would be a great boon to our nation and would strengthen our bond between us should we utilize them."

 R36_countryside_schools_title:0 "Countryside Schools"
 R36_countryside_schools_desc:0 "While we have invested much in the cities, there is talent to be found outside of them too. We should ensure all our people have access to education, that those who show promise may have their talent developed and contribute to the greater whole. Taking a leaf from the Society's grand debate hall, smaller barges with schoolhouses are to be built and floated down the tributaries of the Kharunyana, bringing education easily to more remote and underdeveloped communities."

 R36_we_need_to_know_title:0 "We Need to Know"
 R36_we_need_to_know_desc:0 "The grand temple of Tughayasa is a repository of great knowledge. What's more, the volumes in its collection go back farther than any other library in Haless. We must convince the monks to share that knowledge with our scholars by whatever means necessary, for history may show what the present does not."

 R36_a_bend_in_the_river_title:0 "A Bend in the River"
 R36_a_bend_in_the_river_desc:0 "While the cause of the Kharunyana's stagnation is debated, the more practically-minded amongst our scholars have already begun proposing solutions. Magic has proven useless thus far, as has any manner of alchemy or any form of prayer. We are desperate for a solution and even the most wild ideas are being considered."

 R36_to_the_source_title:0 "To the Source"
 R36_to_the_source_desc:0 "In our efforts to safeguard the Kharunyana, the proposal has been raised that the headwaters of the great river be brought under our protection as well; those who control the headwaters control the source of the river as a whole, after all. We must scale the Godswall and go over the mountains, a colossal undertaking."

 R36_all_deserve_the_harmony_of_the_fish_title:0 "All Deserve the Fish"
 R36_all_deserve_the_harmony_of_the_fish_desc:0 "The wastes through which the headwaters of the Kharunyana flow are inhabited by all manner of other peoples. As we have accepted other beliefs, so too have we brought forth change amongst our people. The bounty of the river shouldn't be denied to others - we must work to bring them into the fold."

 R36_the_great_fish_title:0 "The Great Fish"
 R36_the_great_fish_desc:0 "The rending has brought forth the great Kharunyana's avatar. A colossal catfish, lazily swimming along the length of the river, has been sighted. We must appease the great spirit, that it might continue to bless our lands and people."

 R36_a_river_of_thought_and_debate_title:0 "A River of Thought"
 R36_a_river_of_thought_and_debate_desc:0 "As our reach extends up the western branch of the river, the Hall of Endless Debate falls into our claws. It is still a vaunted and respected locus of discussion, but what if we were to add to it? We must sail the Society's barges to Rayavashapal."

 R36_a_spiritual_awakening_title:0 "A 'Spiritual' Awakening"
 R36_a_spiritual_awakening_desc:0 "Our people have always held that belief is a matter of debate, and changing one's belief is a matter of an open mind and well-spoken arguments. The presence of the Kharunyana is undeniable and the flooded temple at its heart thrums with a spiritual energy. Let us embrace the glory of the fish and the bounty that it has brought to our nation."

 R36_seven_hundred_and_seventy_seven_whiskers_title:0 "777 Whiskers"
 R36_seven_hundred_and_seventy_seven_whiskers_desc:0 "To further our bond with the great spirit, a great festival must be arranged along the entire bank of the Kharunyana. As we flood more and more temples, the process itself has become somewhat ritualized. When we inevitably run out of temples to flood, what will remain? Our craftsmen have been hard at work commemorating these events and firing small porcelain temples moulded as bowls, to be flooded on the day of the festival."

 R36_taking_the_western_branch_title:0 "Taking the Western Branch"
 R36_taking_the_western_branch_desc:0 "The Raj is a twitching husk; a river is only as healthy as that which feeds it. While the Dhenbasana has long been argued to constitute its own river, our philosophers say that technically, it feeds into the Kharunyana and therefore should be treated as part of our realm, to be protected like any other."

 R36_live_long_and_prosper_by_the_fish_title:0 "Prosperity of the Fish"
 R36_live_long_and_prosper_by_the_fish_desc:0 "The entire Kharunyana lies under our protection, from the headwaters to the mouth of the great river where it flows into the sea. We must ensure none forget the blessings that the great fish has brought to us, nor the protection it has granted our nation. Our scholars and philosophers are unparalleled in Haless and bring their knowledge to all in our realm."

 R36_a_traveling_society_title:0 "A Traveling Society"
 R36_a_traveling_society_desc:0 "The Crimson Lotus Society has grown beyond any expectations. Its barges nearly span the entire width of the river, and its continued presence has begun to hinder trade. Almost the entire campus is now afloat... what would it take to move it?"

 R36_the_river_isnt_big_enough_for_the_two_of_us_title:0 "One River, Two Spirits"
 R36_the_river_isnt_big_enough_for_the_two_of_us_desc:0 "We have gained control of the Dhenbasana branch of the river. However, the Rending has brought forth the great elephant spirit of this region, Dhenbasana, in turn. We must begin inundating this region's temples to further grow the strength of the Kharunyana, that it might overcome its neighbor."

 R36_or_is_it_title:0 "A Spiritual Agreement"
 R36_or_is_it_desc:0 "All believe a clash between the two spirits is inevitable, though outright conflict is not our way. We hope that by mending the devastation caused to the land and bringing the bounty of the great fish to the peoples of the Raj, we might prevent that dreaded clash."

 #Events
 flavour_endhuvi.1.t:0 "Setting the Stage"
 flavour_endhuvi.1.d:0 "A letter arrives on the desk of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], it bears the seal of Parusad Bhola, a grand palace, surrounded by ruby flowers - it is a reply, a response to an overture a century overdue. [Root.Monarch.GetName] breaks the seal with a flick of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis]'s claw and begins to read, the response describes the surprise with which Endhuvi's proposal was met in the court of Parusad Bhola. Such skepticism was only overcome, so the [R49.Monarch.GetTitle] writes, by the timely arrival of a supporting statement from the Raja.  They will agree to meet, though it must be on the grounds of their own gardens. [R49.Monarch.GetSheHe] states that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has taken a first step. None of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors have done this, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has taken steps to show their good intentions. They are granting us this one chance to rebuild the bridges between the two nations.\n\nIt will not be an easy road, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] is determined to see it through if possible. The Raja, too, has an interest in seeing this dispute settled. After all, infighting only serves to keep the Raj weak and its enemies are many."
 flavour_endhuvi.1.a:0 "The first step on any road is deciding which way to go."

 flavour_endhuvi.2.t:0 "The Maharaaja Question"
 flavour_endhuvi.2.d:0 "Ten years. In a mere ten years could a conflict of three centuries be ended? The province of Maharaaja, a useful stop on the trade route to and from the lands of the Elephant Lords, had long been a point of conflict between us and Parusad Bhola. \n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] stared out the window of the palace, claws resting on the stone sill of the window. The meeting had gone off without a hitch, and [Root.GetName] had put their best foot forward, but whether the [R49.Monarch.GetTitle] of Parusad Bhola or the Raja would believe it had yet to be seen. Numerous letters had been sent, pleasantries exchanged, and promises made - but would it be enough?\n\nA knock came at the door, a courier stepped inside bearing a letter, the seal of the Raja prominent on the missive. Anxious claws broke the seal and scanned the words within..."
 flavour_endhuvi.2.a:0 "It is ours at last!"
 flavour_endhuvi.2.b:0 "Clearly we weren't convincing enough."

 flavour_endhuvi.3.t:0 "The First Debate"
 flavour_endhuvi.3.d:0 "Jira stood, dressed awkwardly in elaborate robes that ill fit her form. She'd borrowed them from an aunt, part of a whirl of preparation following the news that she'd been picked to join the team sent to the Hall of Endless Debate. The Cinnabar Lotus Society was finally getting its chance; its founders believed that everything was worth questioning and no view was too inconsequential to ignore, but only recently had their perspective come into vogue at court. It was hard to believe, yet here she was, standing in the antechamber of a building which lay right at the centre of High Philosophy, of three thousand years of history. Her peers had already entered and taken their seats - it was time.\n\nThe grand doors swung open, a large round room expanded before her; the wizened gaze of the sages and masters turned to look at her. A lump rose in her throat and her tail twitched nervously as she stepped forward. Compared to this, the Cinnabar Lotus Hall was an old shack,, and she took several halting steps forward. Still, it was everything she'd ever dreamed it would be, even if it was intimidating in the extreme. On her right, a elderly human man smiled and spoke up. "Ah, good, the last of you arrives." As if it were an inquiry after their journey, he continued - "Now, tell us, what is the nature of philosophy?""
 flavour_endhuvi.3.a:0 "Be calm in arguing; for fierceness makes error a fault, and truth discourtesy."

 flavour_endhuvi.4.t:0 "A Philosopher King is Crowned"
 flavour_endhuvi.4.d:0 "The scene resembled a traveller's inn more than a throne room. Arrayed around the room were a mix of delegations from each of the castes, and one particularly large group from the Cinnabar Lotus Society. While normally all would be silent, listening for the word of their ruler, instead various members of each delegation were in fervent argument, eight or ten disputes running in parallel. Beside each set of interlocutors, one member of the Society sat, apparently presiding over the discussion taking place.\n\nAbove it all sat the ruler, who ensured the equal basis on which such free debate depended.\n\nFinally, the head of the Society, a female harimari, dressed in far more presentable robes than the average philosophers, who all could probably have not bothered to dress if it didn't lead to some discussion, cleared her throat, "Everyone! Please, it is time to deliver our answer." One by one, a member of each delegation spoke up, each affirming the idea that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] be advised by each of the castes on all decisions. Such a council would ensure that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] always had the perspective of each caste on every matter concerning the realm. Each of these advisors would be determined by organized debates between the ruler and the proposed candidate. Allowing for both advisor and advised to be tested in their knowledge of the realm and its people."
 flavour_endhuvi.4.a:0 "I know that I know nothing."

 flavour_endhuvi.5.t:0 "The First Ruby Garden Debate"
 flavour_endhuvi.5.d:0 "While there are many places in the world one might consider tranquil, the Ruby Gardens of Parusad Bhola were renowned for it. Quiet covered walkways with intricately carved masonry were surrounded by expansive grounds of painstakingly maintained plants, trees sprawling over vast grounds. Pools of water, some themed with artistic displays of either craft or plant or even both surrounding them, were nestled amongst the lush greenery.\n\nIt was in a quiet corner of the Gardens that the delegates first arrived. First came the diplomats, dressed in their finest and passing only the most courteous and guarded exchanges between each other. All had come to get to know their counterparts well since relations had started to normalize between [Root.GetName] and Parusad Bhola, but there was still a frosty air of formality.\n\nThe next group however, had no such qualms. The polite quiet that had followed the wake of the diplomats was broken; heated words bubbled up from half a dozen conversations. The Philosophers had arrived, dressed in a variety of garb from the ascetic to the ornate, but largely whatever was comfortable to wear for long periods of time and easy to clean. Arguments were being tossed out, grappled with, and verbally thrust back in a debate comparable to some of the most ferocious duels. Some groups had even fallen to  debating amongst their own members, for the question of  how to mend the divide between these two long-time enemies was as vexed domestically as it was diplomatically. \n\nYet finally, a hush fell as the rulers of the nations arrived. A delegate from the Raj, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName] and the [R49.Monarch.GetTitle] of Parusad Bola approached. Each was dressed in their finest, of course, attempting to outdo the others, but they exchanged words of relative calm, a continuation of a written correspondence, perhaps. Settled before the delegations, the first arguments were brought forth - the first of many in a long list of old grievances, ancient massacres, current territorial disputes. Yet address them they did, and by day's end the stiffness that had prevailed at first had given way to cautious optimism. What had gone unaccomplished by blade was falling to the word and pen."
 flavour_endhuvi.5.a:0 "This first debate is the first step towards understanding."

 flavour_endhuvi.6.t:0 "A Fundamental Debate"
 flavour_endhuvi.6.d:0 "Raised voices filled the air inside the palace; the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName] presided, seated on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis]'s throne. Flanking the length of the hall were advisors, harimari and human both, each in constant discourse with their direct opposite. To a layman, it seemed like utter chaos, yet amongst the occasional yell, arguments were being passed. The Praxis had emerged, and the seeds that Guru Suhan had placed on his first trip through [Root.GetName] were sprouting. Instead of dismissing the idea out of hand, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had ordered the Cinnabar Lotus Society to send its debate teams to the palace. One, embodying the Praxis, would try to convince the other that Suhan's philosophy was to be followed, while the other would maintain that the tenets of Darsanasara should remain supreme.\n\nSlowly, one by one, the many pairs of voices fell silent and looked to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], until at last a pregnant silence passed through the hall. This was finally broken as [Root.Monarch.GetName] raised a paw.\n\n"Have you all come to a conclusion?" \n\nThere was a nod from all sides, and the philosopher closest spoke up. "We see no reason to reject the Praxis. To close one's mind to other ideas and beliefs is against the spirit of philosophy, which questions the world and the views in it as a whole." [Root.Monarch.GetName] nodded. "Very well then, send out the missives.""
 flavour_endhuvi.6.a:0 "An open mind is truly best."

 flavour_endhuvi.7.t:0 "You Will Never Find a More Wretched Hive..."
 flavour_endhuvi.7.d:0 "A pair of harimari sat on stools, between them a gameboard. The first moved a piece with the tip of a claw, oblivious to or perhaps uncaring of the sounds around them. The shop before which they sat  boasted several gang members standing watch, while the sound of smashing and shattering wares inside could be heard. The second harimari watched the first make his move.\n\n"... Didn't pay his protection money?" He picked up his own piece and moved over one of his opponents, taking it from the board. The first harimari shook his head. "No, no... they raised the price of ‘protection' just today, didn't you hear?"\n\nOver the steady din of the city streets, the sound of a great war horn could be heard; it echoed from the direction of the city wall. Several ‘guards' went sprinting past, headed in the great noise's direction. The second harimari sighed in weary resignation. The first harimari merely paused, studying the board. "It seems we have newcomers, here to try and tame the streets." He said, and the second shook his head sadly. "Mm... more fools to mire themselves in this rotten place." The distant sound of combat began to creep closer; the first harimari gave a small chuckle. "They will soon find out...""
 flavour_endhuvi.7.a:0 "This isn't the city they're looking for."

 flavour_endhuvi.8.t:0 "The Society Sets Sail"
 flavour_endhuvi.8.d:0 "It was a curious order. Jadu, the shipwright, had fashioned many vessels in his time, all splendid, sturdy craft that plied their trade up and down the great river. But the order currently sitting on his desk was a first, even for him.

All the same, he'd taken the contract; in a few months time, everyone would be treated to a sight as perplexing as it was impressive.\n\nTwo months later, a building floated down the great river, guided from the shoreline by teams of elephants and their handlers. A great barge bore the structure, the widest barge the river had seen yet, spanning nearly shore to shore at the Kharunyana's narrowest points. The building's roof was plain wood, though a large dull-red lotus flower was proudly displayed above each of the four doors. A promenade ran around the entire perimeter of the hall, wide enough for three abreast to stroll comfortably, with seating beneath the large roof awning. The barge lumbered its way down the river until finally bumping comfortably into posts sunk along the shore, dwarfing the  former meeting hall beside which it had moored. Ropes were lashed, and a gangplank set in place. Teams had scarcely begun detaching the elephants before the eager philosophers began climbing aboard. The Cinnabar Lotus Society's new debate hall was open for business!"

What years ago, amounted to a death warrant for any lawbringer in this city was now becoming commonplace. His footpaws gripped the cobbled street stones as he walked; he knew every one of them. A shopkeeper hawking his wares could be heard on the opposite side of the street, and carts trundled along, clattering on the stones. \n\nHe came to a stop at the end of the block, where the river marked the edge of the district. Before him, riverboats came and went from the vast array of small docks and piers that lined every meter of riverfront. In front of a house a stone's throw away, a pair of elderly harimari sat, hunched before a gameboard, muttering quietly to one another.

What had been born of a mere need  for more space had become a trademark of the Society. Riverboats passed through a narrow channel left between the barges of the campus, walkways elevated or small drawbridges raised to allow their passage.\n\nTraders and merchants peddled their goods to the philosophers as they passed: the freshest produce, richest spices, and latest news passed through. While the Watermarkets of Sarisung peddled goods, the Society traded in ideas. Endless chatter, day and night, kept the campus vibrant; young philosophers made it a tradition to try and convince a merchant of something, anything, by the time they finished passing through. Yet still ideas flowed, new and old, foolish and innovative, debated heatedly by those of the Society. Not just philosophy was debated, but the sciences and arts - ideas were challenged and wrestled with,  brought back in reconfigured iterations and challenged again. The local villages too knew the Society as skilled mediators, bringers of education and wisdom."

Yet somehow, when he had spoken up amongst all the advisors and mages at the latest grand debate on how best to resolve the stagnation of the Kharunyana, they'd agreed. The mages had merely shrugged – the High Temples weren't their domain anyway – and while the outcry from the Darsanasara delegation had shaken the hall, even they were silenced by the arguments Fahes had presented. If the spirits and the temples were connected, then why not connect them literally, dig channels and flood the temples? Nothing else had worked thus far, no amount of engineering or magic could encourage the river to flow again. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had looked at him, deep in thought and nodded [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] assent to the idea, adding these words of wisdom, "If you rule out the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the answer. We will do this."\n\nSo here he was, overseeing the dig towards the nearest suitable High Temple. A channel for the water was carved through the jungles, hundred of laborers toiled with axes, picks, and shovels, while a separate team worked to build a floodwall around the perimeter of the site. They were days away from opening the floodgates and inundating the temple. Fahes scratched his chin, no one knew what to expect, least of all him."

People began to gather  at the shore, marveling at such a peculiar sight. So captivating was the vast school that the shifting waters escaped people's attention at first; that down the channel, at the rivers edge, water had begun to flow. Spreading from the point the channel merged with the river, the waters began to move once more, a small tide formed. The water lifted boats gently, pushing those down river along a bit faster than their captains probably expected. Upstream too, like a long rope being tugged, the waters began to flow along and movement returned to the river."

 flavour_endhuvi.300.t:0 "A Shadowy Companion"
 flavour_endhuvi.300.d:0 "Our Senapti Vapyatar VI has gone some years without an heir. Perhaps it was due to his vituperative reaction when Parusad Bhola appointed the first female Senapti, misogynistic even by the standards of Senapti of the Raj, but there have been few offers of marriage. The court has thus decided to take things into its own hands.\n\nA few years ago, discreet envoys were sent by the nobles to ‘friends' in nearby realms, and one has now returned with interest. Asima of the Crouching Shadow has for some time wished to escape her family's grasp - their ‘backwards' ways, as she sees them. While our Senapti is notoriously reactionary, his court is not, and Asima's situation is not one in which she can be choosy. Knowing the mismatch between ruler and elite, she sees too an opportunity.\n\nEnvisioning the future of the harimari not as one of conquest, but of clever words and skillful statescraft, she began a correspondence with our court - not merely on matters of state, but also on art and philosophy, a wooing of our finest. Thus, some months later, she arrived by quiet ship up the river with her young son in tow. The young harimari has proven himself to be competent and quick to learn the intricacies of the realm, endearing him despite everything to our old-fashioned Senapti. Certainly, his mother's own skills are quite formidable as well. In such a way,  the Crouching Shadow's claws curl around Endhuvi..."

 flavour_endhuvi.301.t:0 "Holding Court"
 flavour_endhuvi.301.d:0 "It had been less than two months since Asima arrived. In that time, the court of Endhuvi had changed dramatically. [Root.Monarch.GetName] found his advisors busy or abroad for various tasks whenever he sought to discuss matters of state with them. Almost unbeknownst to [Root.Monarch.GetName] was that Asima was holding her own, informal councils already. Not once since her arrival had she warmed the Senapti's bed, or even stayed in his estates. While her first invitation to Endhuvi was at the behest of the court, it quickly became apparent to her how badly the state needed a new hand to guide it.\n\nShe had already sent out surreptitious emissaries to the Raja and to Parusad Bhola, promising a new page in the relations between the two nations; meanwhile, her son was being carefully encouraged to observe, young though he was, to learn the lessons his mother was showing him. The few times she'd allow him to interact with  [Root.Monarch.GetName] were carefully stewarded and planned, usually in such a manner to highlight the current Senapti's backwards or incompetent diplomacy. Advisors visibly tensed and members of the court muttered under their breath that something had to change."

 flavour_endhuvi.302.d:0 "It had taken Asima several years to finish laying the groundwork. Having the support of the court was crucial in this undertaking, especially so that things went smoothly. Her son was growing up quickly and would soon be ready to take the throne himself.\n\nShe stood quietly at the heart of her small estate, a tense expression on her face; a slight breeze rustled the tops of the bamboo grove. Just as the wind brought with it a change of the skies, so too had she brought change to Endhuvi. A light step caused her to turn back to face the young, golden-furred face of her son, a questioning look aimed in her direction.\n\n“Is everything alright, mother?"\n\n“Yes. The stage is set, now all that remains is for everyone to play their part. Including you."\n\nThe young Harimari gave her a slightly reproachful look; Asima's face softened. She opened her arms and he leaned into the hug. A clawed hand lightly scritched the top of his scalp, just like he'd enjoyed as a young child.\n\n“It has been a long journey for us both. I know that you've had to play many roles, even before you knew whose play you were a part of."\n\nHe gave her a small squeeze and leaned back to look up at his mother,\n\n“It's all for a good cause, mother. I share your dream of a world that everyone can contribute to."\n\nAsima's eyes watered slightly, and she hugged her son even tighter."
