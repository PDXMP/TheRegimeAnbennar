When Hytiranyalen was at its zenith, as half of the Dual Queendom, what brought us down was the elven invasion of our nation. When this brutal attack took place, all of Bulwar applauded, seeing us as monsters to banish. The opinion of us abroad has improved since, but it still is not enough.\n\nSend envoys among the Sun followers; entice other races to visit; proclaim our roost open to everybody!"

The idea of regaining control of the ancient capital is filling many harpies with patriotic fervor, and already many are volunteering for the army.\n\nThat doesn't mean everybody joins is feeling the spirit, voices reminding everyone two millenia have passed since Hytiranyalen ruled those lands.

Then the answer is wild sweaty state-building.\nAlready when the pact was initially signed the goal was for it to last. But the impressive string of successes our alliance has collected since smoothed all the bumps that were expected to happen, so much that we're considered as one by all foreign dignitaries - we even gained a new moniker from them, the Marble Queendom.\n\nWe need to take advantage of the positive atmosphere and push integration further, and proclaim the union a single nation. The real challenge, making the proclamation reality, will take time: much of the administrations and militaries will have to remain independent; but some mixed corps will be established, and from those seeds we'll build our future together."

Their promises are all words in the wind, just a ploy to better grab absolute power.\n\nWe were forced to keep our heads down after the fall of our Queendom, even bow to that peep of headless chickens, but no more. We have a newfound friend in Perzuk, the better half of the Marble goblins' diarchy: launch a diplomatic assault on the court of Aqatabar, with the brother whispering in one ear and a harpy in the other, and Idrarseff won't be able to say no.\n\nSend word to our old allies of Lysinyalen to ready themselves; let’s have a meeting with the other queens.\n\nFlare up the rivalry again, for one last dance."

No book or document survived the hold fall, but through careful study (something more akin to archeology than engineering, really) we might get an inkling on how they worked, a starting point for our own specialists, something to get inspired by."

Now it's time to improve the rails, adding our personal, magical, touch. Bring the cold breeze down from the mountaintop to the stale tunnels cutting its inside.

Our spells don't evoke a small effect from who knows where like most magic does, they sing to the world to channel a past state of it; the smallest gust of wind has been at one point in time tempest. The spells are much stronger as a result, the energy you can pull from nature's memory is different.\nBut it has drawbacks: innovation is much more difficult, memories are malleable only up to a point; and it does require an harpy song, no way around it. Other races can't do it, writing the lyrics does nothing, and teaching a harpy to sing magic is no shorter than any other mage apprenticeship. This is particularly bad if I want to integrate our magic in the New Way.\nNo matter, just a counterwind. Contact the masters of the song in Misarallen, with their help we'll crack the nut."

It's the pet project of Karodir I, first among elven mages, Arkimaguš of one of the most important Magi Clans.

To actually bring magic to everyone we'll need tons of Sihariš and Anniwan!\n\nWe need to boost production of those materials, like now! And this means copper, tin, lapis lazuli - blast open our hills, gather every vein. And procure the damn damestear… I can't seem to do without the stupid mineral.

Some order is needed - I refuse to let my creation take after me in that aspect.\n\nMagical Order. There's one place that still knows more than me on the matter, even on good days: Annail.

If anything many seem to have a new twinkle in their eyes, walking around with a newfound pride. And the sheer amount of harpies around! Hytiranyalen wasn't so bustling when I left. The market plaza is full of hagglers begging the vendors for discounts. Harpies not of our flock, the lot of them. And many merchants peddling luxury wares, a rare sight in my memories. They all have plenty of clients too!\n\nAnd yet, the residence of the Vetaunyar next to the palace is unchanged. The queue of hopefuls outside of it is as long as it always was, all praying to find a mage willing to listen to their requests, possibly without having to sell the jewelry to pay for it.\nWell, now that I'm back this won't keep going for long.

But I did manage to listen to lessons while working, and look at the books a lot! Do you need help?"\n\nShe's still there, staring at me… Creepy. But these books are a rarity - some of them are ancient! - focus on them.\n\n"Yes! This is what I needed!" damn, I shouted that. The natural world is the answer, I knew it. We channel a minuscule amount of its energy, I can take so much more, it has been done before. Quick, back home, need to test.\n"Are you going?"\nSkies. "Yes, I'm returning to Hytiranyalen.

The plaza where the parade ended and the ceremony would take place was packed to the brim of people of all races. Conquerors and conquered, humans, harpies, elves. And goblins. So many goblins, going utterly wild: whistling, hooting, doing weird group dances.\n\nThis prompted some subtle whispers between the newlyweds:\n"Look at them, they were fighting us less than a month ago, now they seem overjoyed by our presence. I'll be honest, such two-faced opportunism is unpleasant to me."\n"It's not like that really. They're genuine, mostly. Us goblins, we're used to abrupt changes. This makes us take things as they come, and enjoy the present if we can. Today's a party, so they're gonna party hard. And, well… many goblins have a… let's say idealized view of harpies."\n"I'll take your word for it, thanks for sparing me the details of what this "ideal" entails. Good. It means this political marriage is working."\n\nThe culmination of the day, after many shamanic rites, long tired smiles, solemn discourses, was the officiation of the marriage, with the gift-swapping between the spouses: a branch of a Sycamore from [Root.Monarch.GetName] representing unity, a marble brick from Perzuk to build a new life.

It's by embracing their wild approach to science that I thought of sousing cotton with caprine saliva, after all!"\n\n"Nyamau, if you and your goblin clique don't rebuild the left wing of my palace by next week, and cleanse the garden of the goat entrails DOWN TO THE VERY LAST PEBBLE by tomorrow, I'm gonna torch every feather of your very large behind then parade you upside-down across the entire realm!

And yet I keep meandering around it during our hunts.\n\nWhat could be hidden inside? How glorious must be the great rooms chiseled out of the stone? The goblins tell me only ruin and death is left in those halls, but they just didn't have the aptitude for it when they invaded the hold - they just wanted treasures.\nThe architecture, the machinery, the thousand years old science must be there, or at least some traces of it, waiting to be rediscovered.

It wasn't the case now, you'd see very few families among the crowd: nobody wanted their child to grow up in the caverns.\n"They say there's gonna be new opportunities inside the mountains, with free gold given by the Harpy Queen… And I believe them, I won't miss going to bed hungry - still, I hate it."\n\nSticking out like a sore thumb, a handful of bright-eyed harpies were also marching downwards, earning sneering looks from everyone present.
