 sareyand_patronage_of_the_landlords_desc:0 "The unfortunate setbacks of the last decades have eroded the well-deserved trust our nobles once placed in the Sarelzuir dynasty. In particular, the Sun Elven Ralkadezim gentry in their mansions in the countryside, who have traditionally been ardent supporters of Sareyand and its claim to hegemony over the Suran plain, have shown a concerning degree of reluctance to provide their usual tribute in recent years.\nOnly by strengthening their involvement in the institutions of our realm, and thus their personal investment in its continued prosperity, can we hope to restore this crumbling pillar of support to its former strength. Once the Ralkadezim are again united behind the throne, none shall be able to doubt the right of the house Sarelzuir to rule Sareyand and all of Bulwar."

 sareyand_rebuild_the_ash_palace_title:0 "Rebuild the Ash Palace"
 sareyand_rebuild_the_ash_palace_desc:0 "The Ash Palace of Sareyand is a true marvel of architecture, born from both Bulwari and Sun Elven aesthetic traditions. The dastardly assassination attempt on Jexis three centuries ago left not only her but the palace itself with indelible scars.\nThe Burning left most of the palace uninhabitable, with only the southern wing currently fully restored. With the realm united behind the Sarelzuir dynasty once again and the immediate threats from beyond our borders dealt with, it is only fitting that the restoration project is resumed.\nJust as the Ash Phoenix of Sareyand is once more ascendant, its wings spread over the Suran plain, the Ash Palace needs to be restored to its former glory. Only then can it truly serve as the glittering heart of Sareyand, a fitting residence for our exalted monarch once again."

 sareyand_artists_of_triumph_desc:0 "It is a tragic but undeniable truth that, even for such a long-lived race as the elves, all things end. One day the last eyewitness of even our greatest triumphs will pass on into the embrace of Surael’s Light. And over centuries, even the most accurate recollections inevitably fade.\nTo preserve an enduring impression of our grand victories and heroic achievements for future generations, a special corps of our army has been created: the Artists of Triumph and Trial. Staffed by some of the most promising artists of their generation, their sole duty is to accompany our grand legions and our most noble monarch, using their talent with paintbrush, charcoal, chisel and clay to immortalise their trials and triumphs for posterity. A gallery in the recently restored eastern wing of the Ash Palace has been reserved to display their works of art. Their creations shall inspire future generations to ever greater accomplishments in the name of glorious Sareyand."

 sareyand_sunshine_manors_title:0 "Sunshine Manors"
 sareyand_sunshine_manors_desc:0 "Many foreigners subscribe to the erroneous image of Bulwar as an arid land of dry plains and deserts, but while there are arid wastelands to be found, these are just one part of the colourful tapestry that makes up Bulwar. The land between the waters of Suran and Buranun, as well as the verdant plains around lake Naza and the lands irrigated by the clear waters of rivers like the Hatatun, Avamezan and Betlamaš constitute some of the most fertile farmlands in the known world.\nBy marrying millennia of Bulwari agricultural tradition with the patient guidance of the Sun Elven gentry - who, lounging in their Sunshine Manors, tend to prefer long-term results to short-term gains - the productivity of our bucolic hinterland has increased immensely. Thanks to their wise traditional policy of continuous investment, not just in our capital but the entire realm, the rich harvests gathered by the large estates in our realms do not just fill the bellies of peasants and city dwellers alike, but the resulting prosperity flows into the coffers of our loyal nobility and our royal treasury year after year."

 sareyand_the_sad_sur_title:0 "The Šad Sur"
 sareyand_the_sad_sur_desc:0 "The Šad Sur, the Mountains of the Sun, have always shielded the fertile river valleys of Bulwar from the harsh desert winds of the Salahad, and its even more grim inhabitants. For many centuries, the proud Šadnatu called the valleys between these peaks their home, and served as fierce guardians of Surael’s Garden. Yet not unlike ourselves, mere decades ago even these courageous servants of Surael had to acknowledge defeat and flee their homeland in the face of unrelenting attacks by gnollish slavers.\nIf we are to honour our sacred oaths to shield the lands of Bulwar, we can no longer stand idly by and accept this grave injustice. The Ashen Legion shall break the hold of these despicable slavers over the Šad Sur and return this rugged land to its rightful inhabitants. And once their stain is removed from these mountains, we shall erect a mighty fortress that will ensure that none may dare threaten the Šad Sur and the Garden of Surael beyond ever again!"

 sareyand_lords_of_the_suran_desc:0 "Fetid and fecund, the marshy lowlands of the lower Suran have not only fed the ever-hungry metropolis of Brasan for untold centuries, but grown many of the coveted commodities that draw merchants from farflung lands to the city’s many bazaars.\nAny Bulwari empire worth its lentils sooner or later attempts to control Brasan, the entrepot of Bulwar, and its affluent surroundings. For only they may truly call themselves Lords of the Suran who control Brasan, the Port of Emperors, where all the riches created along the length of the Suran must eventually gather.\nThe lifeblood of all of Bulwar flows through the Suran, and with its estuary an integral part of our realm, none shall doubt our rightful claim as the inheritors of the Phoenix Empire of old. And even if our rivals would be foolish enough to do so, the melodious chink of our newly filled coin purses will drown out any dissenting voices."

 sareyand_recover_the_suran_plain_title:0 "Recover the Suran Plain"
 sareyand_recover_the_suran_plain_desc:0 "It has only been less than twenty years since the vile horde of Zokka came rushing out of the desert and occupied our rightful lands along the upper Suran, capitalising on a moment of weakness after their cowardly ambush in the wastes of Ardu which cost many of our noble legionaries their lives, and our exalted king Erelas his left arm.\nBut our forces have not been idle in the intervening years. The Ash Legion has filled its ranks with new recruits, the border forts have been restored, the supply depots filled to the brim; all is ready for a most righteous war of reclamation.\nOnce the legion begins its march, neither savage gnolls nor fanatical desert nomads shall stand in our way. Who could doubt that it is Surael’s Will that we restore rightful Sareyandi rule over these ravaged lands, slay the beasts that despoiled it, and cleanse this long-suffering part of Surael’s sacred Garden. Let those who bent the knee to gnollish masters swear their fealty to the Sunfire Throne of Sareyand, or else suffer the same fate as their former masters."

 sareyand_sun_elven_aegis_desc:0 "With the gnollish incursion along the upper Suran finally dealt with, it is now time to restore the proper order of things. The High Kašra of the sacred triple temple of Eduz-Vacyn, eldest amongst the temples of Surael, and the heroic marcher lords of Harklum, guarding the banks of the Suran against any threat from the southern desert, may rest easy once more. Now that the ashen phoenix of Sareyand shelters them again beneath its wings, their lands are safe.\nTo our everlasting shame, we may have faltered for a while in our sacred duty to protect Surael’s Garden and its inhabitants against the machinations of the Malevolent Dark, but we have never truly abandoned our calling. Let everyone see that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] honors his obligations before Surael and to those who have sworn fealty to him. All under the aegis of Sareyand shall enjoy the protection of the Ash Legion."

 sareyand_reclaim_the_inheritance_title:0 "Reclaim the Inheritance"
 sareyand_reclaim_the_inheritance_desc:0 "The last king of Dalarand may have been a warmongering fool who ultimately destroyed his realm, but his blood runs through the veins of the Sarelzuir dynasty, which makes [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] the last legitimate heir to the kingdom of Dalarand.\nReclaiming that inheritance and putting the Varamzuir upstarts in their place has long been  overdue. With the heartlands of Sareyand once more firmly secured and safe from outside incursions, the Ash Legion is prepared to march upon Varamhar and restore the rightful ruler of the lands of fallen Dalarand to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] throne, one way or another."

 sareyand_the_heart_of_bulwar_title:0 "The Heart of Bulwar"
 sareyand_the_heart_of_bulwar_desc:0 "The lands along the Suran have been settled for millennia, home to the most venerable human civilisation on the face of Halann. Countless city-states, kingdoms and empires have risen and fallen along these hallowed waters.\nWith the wings of the Ashen Phoenix now spread across this ancient heartland of Bulwari civilisation, it falls to Sareyand to ensure that the three sacred Suranic Temples - Azka-Sur, Eduz-Vacyn and Bulwar itself - are properly guarded and maintained at a level of splendor befitting such exalted centers of the Sun Cult.\nProving ourselves as generous patrons of the Suranic Temples will indubitably strengthen our claim as the rightful inheritors of the Phoenix Empire’s legacy, helping garner broad support across Bulwar for our attempt to restore the empire."

 sareyand_true_heirs_of_jexis_title:0 "True Heirs of Jexis"
 sareyand_true_heirs_of_jexis_desc:0 "Many were the detractors who have doubted our destiny, many were the rivals who futilely attempted to usurp our rightful place, and many were the foes who failed to extinguish the cleansing fire we called forth from the ashes.\nBut we have persevered, never failing in our pursuit of our hallowed duties, and, in due time, have risen above them all. None can deny now that we truly are the heirs of Jexis, destined to reunite all of Bulwar - and beyond - under the wings of the Ashen Phoenix.\nHear the clarion call of the Ash Legion and rejoice, oh faithful servants of Surael, for His chosen champions once more guards His most sacred Garden, the phoenix has risen from the ashes once again!"

 sareyand_restore_order_in_azka_sur_title:0 "Restore Order in Azka-Sur"
 sareyand_restore_order_in_azka_sur_desc:0 "Sareyand was not the target of Zokka’s malevolent incursions. The kingdom of Azka-Sur, easternmost center of Bulwari civilisation and guardian of the sacred temple of Eduz-Meduru, suffered a grievous loss when its last elven king, Erlian Surzuir, perished while protecting Hašri refugees from the gnollish horde.\nAs Zokka has finally choked on his greed and his horde has been scattered to the winds, it now falls to us to restore the proper order and return elven rule to Azka-Sur. This way, our eastern flank will be guarded by a steadfast ally and the banks of the upper Suran kept safe from our enemies, be they plundering gnolls or riled-up desert nomads."

 sareyand_no_more_gnolls_title:0 "No More Gnolls"
 sareyand_no_more_gnolls_desc:0 "For countless centuries, the gnollish spawn of Amaštu have plagued the faithful denizens of Surael’s Garden. While a blessed few amongst their number, the Suncrown Gnolls, have turned their backs on the depraved traditions of their accursed kin and turned towards Surael’s Light, most gnolls remain utterly devoted to the cause of the Malevolent Dark and rejoice in the suffering they cause.\nThey have been granted countless opportunities to repent, but they stubbornly insist on profaning themselves before their demonic masters. And who can deny that those who reject the Light of Surael have no place within His Garden? The task before us is therefore clear: We shall cleanse the lands of Bulwar of the stain caused by their malignant gnollish rites, and chase all who refuse to join us on the side of His Light to the dark corners of the world, or else slay them where they stand."

 sareyand_the_rogue_legion_title:0 "The Rogue Legion"
 sareyand_the_rogue_legion_desc:0 "After the foul murder of emperor Jaerel, many but not all members of the Phoenix Legion returned to us from the seditious east. The members of the Desert Legion, while honourable and brave, have been led astray by the machinations of Erelessa and the honeyed words of her delusional puppet, the false prophet Jaddar.\nThey truly thought they could stand against the might of the Ash Legion, and wrest our destiny from our hands. Instead, they have been humbled and shown the error of their ways. With them and their Mašnsih allies brought in line and their vast desert homeland now loyal to the Sunfire Throne of Sareyand, it would be utter folly to let the fierce fire of their zeal go to waste when it might instead be directed towards our mutual enemies."

 sareyand_the_shining_monastery_title:0 "The Shining Monastery"
 sareyand_the_shining_monastery_desc:0 "One of the most unique consequences of Jaher’s eastern campaigns has been the development of the ‘Way of the Blazing Sun’, a unique magical tradition marrying ancestral Sun Elven practices with the chi-fuelled martial arts of the monasteries of Xianjie.\nIts practitioners are temple-trained exorcist-priests who, through years of rigorous meditation and exercise, have learned to call forth Surael’s Light in a blazing burst of radiance. A light born from faith which can be used to illuminate even the darkest night.\nTraditionally these monks reside within the temple grounds of the city temple of Sareyand, but it is high time that we honour their invaluable contributions to our realm’s fidelity and safety by providing them with a separate residence, the Shining Monastery. This most exalted monastery shall be filled with prayer halls, dormitories, libraries and training facilities, all in service of the greater glory of Surael."

 sareyand_the_blazing_temple_title:0 "The Blazing Temple"
 sareyand_the_blazing_temple_desc:0 "Due in large part to our generous patronage of their order, the devotees of the Blazing Sun have steadily risen in number over the last years, and the luminous displays of their faith performed for the devout have drawn an increasing number of the faithful eager to witness such marvellous signs of Surael’s blessing.\nTo accommodate these pilgrims, a new holy site - the Blazing Temple - has been constructed. It is a grand religious complex from where the monks may spread their teachings to our devout subjects.\nAlready multiple dependent satellite cloisters have sprung up in the countryside around Sareyand, bringing the teachings of the Way of the Blazing Sun to local faithful. Eager to use their Surael-given talents in the eternal Struggle, an increasing number of the monks eschew the secluded existence of cloistered meditation upon the nature of Surael, instead petitioning the throne to be allowed to join our legions."

 sareyand_iron_to_ashes_title:0 "Iron to Ashes"
 sareyand_iron_to_ashes_desc:0 "While the monks of the Way of the Blazing Sun have devoted their life to studying the emanations of Surael’s Light in this world, their unique skills are not merely spiritual, but can be utilized for decidedly martial purposes. Calling forth a radiant blaze to blind an entire enemy host, or else reducing even the most heavily ironclad opposing warrior to mere ashes - these are just two of these potential applications. We would be utterly foolish and waste this gift of Surael they have been granted if we did not recruit those amongst their number with martial inclinations to join our Ash Legion.\nBy placing the task of magical education for all our subjects with the ability to wield arcane powers in the hands of the Blazing Temple, we shall create a Blazing Priesthood whose members deploy their innate talents in service of Surael and Sareyand alike."
 
 sareyand_ashes_to_iron_title:0 "Ashes to Iron"
 sareyand_ashes_to_iron_desc:0 "We Sareyandi are all children of the phoenix, Surael’s own herald Sarnagir, born from ashes and destined to rise clad in the fires of His incandescent Light. In service of His Order, we strive to carry the Light to even the darkest corners of the world.\nEach trial, each tribulation only strengthens our resolve. For we are destined to rise from the ashes of defeat unbent, unbowed, unbroken; filled with a core of molten iron, eager to incinerate all who oppose our sacred cause.\nFor by the grace of Surael, all of us have become children of the ash."

 sareyand_the_great_ash_legion_title:0 "The Great Ash Legion"
 sareyand_the_great_ash_legion_desc:0 "It is the most noble calling for any of our subjects, be they elf, human, dwarf or even harpy or centaur, to serve in the Ash Legion. The legion is the rightful inheritor of the legacy of the Phoenix Legion, which once spread Surael’s Light from the western shores of Cannor to the far eastern corners of the world, freeing the myriad peoples inhabiting these lands who so suffered under the sway of Darkness.\nWith both the elven veterans of the Cinder Wars and the remnants of the recalcitrant Desert Legion reunited into one force, Sareyand is undeniably the home of the most disciplined elite fighting force Bulwar and indeed all of Halann have ever seen. Under the rigorous training regime of these veterans, our forces shall rise to the exacting standards of the hallowed warriors who gained victory after victory across Halann. This way, the Ash Legion will swiftly surpass even the legendary Phoenix Legion, an army worthy of a new empire."

 flavour_sareyand.1.t:0 "Andrellian Companions"
 flavour_sareyand.1.d:0 "Over the millennia, the basic organisational unit of Bulwari society has always been the city state. One city might at times dominate its neighbors, or be subjugated by nomadic overlords from beyond the fecund river basin, but inevitably, after the fall of kingdom, queendom or empire, the city state reasserts itself as the center of authority for its environs.\nYet between the Serpentspine, the middle Suran and the Harpy Hills, in the lands around lake Naza, another order has been established. Since the time of the Akalite kingdom, it is not just the cities which hold sway over the fertile countryside, but the vast mansions of the Ralkadezim have become the radiant sun around which the villages in their vicinity orbit.\nEach lord and lady of the Ralkadezim is their own little king or queen in their sprawling country estates, ruling over their domain just as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] rules over all of Sareyand. And just as the villagers work the fields and orchards of the mansions, fixed in their orbit around the estate, so do the mansions in turn orbit around the gloriously brilliant sun of the Sunfire Throne of Sareyand and its occupant.\nAnd just as the light of the sun illuminates everything it touches, so does the connection between monarch and Ralkadezim invest the latter with legitimacy and authority over their vast estates. In return, the Ralkadezim lend their strength grown from their deep roots in the countryside to the monarchy.\nMany a second or third son or daughter of theirs has chosen to pursue a career in the army instead of an uncertain future at the sufferance of their elder sibling and heir of the estate.\nThe most promising among their ranks are inducted in the elite cavalry corps of the Andrellian Companions, named after the Sun Elven paragon of discipline, sworn only to the throne and each other. Their members lead an existence as confirmed bachelors and bachelorettes, living in the royal barracks as roommates devoted to each other. Wherever their banner flies, the simple soldiers of the Ash Legion are roused to battle fervor, secure in the knowledge that the invincible Andrellian Companions shall shatter even the most impenetrable enemy line."

Keladora Dalzuir, sister to doomed Daraztarion, was the mother of Eledas Sarelzuir, making him the rightful ruler of both Sareyand and the lands of fallen Dalarand.\nWith the gnollish threat dealt with and the eastern borderlands of Sareyand reclaimed, it was high time that we repaid the Varamzuirs for their treachery, took their vassals, wiped Varamhar from the map and resurrected the realm of Dalarand in its stead - with [Root.Monarch.GetName] on its throne, of course."

Yet on this most auspicious day, even the usual throng pales in comparison to the masses gathered in anticipation of the forthcoming celebrations. The market squares are filled with food banquets for the masses, the bazaars and avenues of the city host countless artisans, acrobats and storytellers engaged to entertain the masses.\nThese festivities are held not just on occasion of the the crown jubilee of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], but as a grandiose celebration of the end of the lamentable divisions that have plagued Bulwar ever since the collapse of the Phoenix Empire. No longer is Surael’s Garden divided into petty fiefdoms of even pettier kings, squabbling over the last remnants of lost grandeur and impotently watching as the servants of the Darkness rose once more to threaten the faithful.\nNow, all of His sacred Garden, from the Mountain of Clear Sight all along the Suran to the estuary of our hallowed river, are gathered under the spread wings of the Ashen Phoenix, safe from outside threats and internecine struggles alike. With the land finally at peace, its pious inhabitants enjoy a prosperity not seen since the times of empress Jexis.\nAnd within the Ash Palace itself, the nobility of the realm, its many client states and emissaries from great powers all across Halann are assembled to pay homage to the glorious reign of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Clad in glittering jewels and shining silks, they fill the halls and gardens of the palace with a marvelous display of elegant opulence.

While the rare blessed few amongst their number may have chosen the path of Light, most of their ilk have spurned every opened hand, every opportunity of redemption, over and over again.\nNow, there will be no more chances, no more mercy extended to those who have proven beyond a doubt their utter degradation.

They were found both amongst the ranks of the Desert Legion, as some of the veterans of Jaher’s eastern campaigns had studied the chi techniques of the Xiaken during the time of the Phoenix Empire, as well as amongst the szal-Attalu tribe, whose unique style of martial arts - called Ahu Alaktu - has been practiced by the Ahušessu warriors for centuries.\nMerging their traditions with the practices developed at the Shining Monastery soon resulted in a unique tradition, the Way of the Desert Fire, whose acolytes could soon be found all across the Far Salahad."

It has become a daily spectacle for the city’s faithful to observe the meditative trances performed by the monks and admire the whispers of pure sunlight undulating across their forms.\nWhile many on the Way see their calling in meditative contemplation of Surael’s Order, or the guidance of the faithful towards His Light, some take a more militant stance, eager to bring the fight towards the servants of the Malevolent Dark. These monks flock towards the ranks of the Kašipti, or exorcist-priests, who no longer administer just to the needs of the faithful under the auspices of the local temple, but can increasingly be found accompanying the armies of [Root.GetName] on their holy mission to vanquish the Dark."

Merchants from southern Cannor and northern Sarhal congregate here and mingle with the merchants of Bulwar, creating an atmosphere of exchange both mercantile and intellectual. Of particular note is the city's connection to the Cannorian city of Port Jaher. The two cities are somewhat sisters, with many merchants having residences in both. This means that new ideas that spread to one city quickly spread to the other."

During the height of the market season, the city becomes an ocean of people, with great tent cities built outside to handle the incoming merchants and their goods. Such a great mass of weary and wealthy travelers attracts mongers and performers in the same manner as a smaller market, turning the meeting of merchants into something like a festival. Within this atmosphere, ideas flow as freely as coin and drink, giving Bulwar any new insights from the Raheni caravanserai city of Davharral and giving the merchants of Rahen new ideas to carry back to that city on the return trip."
