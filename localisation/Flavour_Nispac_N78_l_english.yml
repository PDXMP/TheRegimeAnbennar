 flavour_nispac.1.t: "A Shadow Over Nianano"
 flavour_nispac.1.d: "Narration from the POV of Durari Degsadra, very paranoid about the current situation of the kingdom. That same day they called their advisors and generals to the throne room to plan a defense of the capital if so needed. Both groups seem wary of the image this will pose to the already unhappy population but Durari does not listen.\nCut to the marketplace where voices talk in quiet about the happenings, people seem to agitated. 2 hooded people listen to the talk in silence.\nThe people kept talking as the walls of Nianano kept being reinforced. As they work they would also paint the walls with words, propaganda for Durari - styling himself the only to sit atop The Great Cycle of The One. The more time passed, the more they spread his propaganda until it reaches every corner of the realm and beyond.\nThese words did not sit well with the people, an already unpopular ruler was preparing to defend itself against its own people, spreading words about its greatness.\nSoon discontent rose, first was the people of Nianano itself who refused to fund this effort any more. Tax collectors were lynched on the streets and the money used instead to vandalise all the Durari propaganda."
 flavour_nispac.1.a: "The Kingdom is in Disarray"
 flavour_nispac.2.t: "Tyrant Call"
 flavour_nispac.2.d: "The Riots did not stop at Nianano. Soon they spread to the rest of the realm.\nBut no region was affected more by them than the city of Imbatano, its ogre population were tired of having seen the rise of their legal discrimination inside the realm their kin once helped build. They had it bad but with Durari they had it even worse, he was a notorious discriminator against the ogrekin and the new laws of the realm were sure to always reflect that. Even as Nianano was submerged in chaos they still had time to send the army to Imbatano to oppress the ogre population further. But this time the Ogres fear no longer, for amongst their kin they had found ready to rise up and free them from this oppression.\nThe news spread like wildfire, amongst the Maghalmtianebi a reborn hero had risen to the cause of freedom. Together with their human partner they had begun to organize the resistance against Durari and are now assembling an army to break the rotten kingdom.\nLocals from all around the realm rise up to the cause, ready to break this crown to the grown to build something new."
 flavour_nispac.2.a: "Rotten Monsters, no peace until they are all in chains!"
 flavour_nispac.3.t: "End of the False Cycle"
 flavour_nispac.3.d: "It began early in the morning. Every peasant, every smith and craftsman and even some members of the military rose to arms to meet their tyrant one last time. They saw freedom, safety and peace, but above all else they saw to end this crown of tyrants. They called themselves the highest of a cycle yet said the cycle was born from hatred and brutality, it could not be allowed to last.\nIt was a brutal siege, the core of Nianano had been turned into a fortress that seemed almost impenetrable. It took many hours to crack it open but once it was done the people poured in like a flood. (The 2 cool dudes) ran to the main castle to find Durari, she/he could not escape this at all.\nThey finally found him/her trying to flee the scene, once it was in their hand…"
 flavour_nispac.3.a: "(Cool Ogre Dude) watches as (Cool Human Partner) kills Durari"
 flavour_nispac.3.b: "(Cool Human Partner) kills Durari with his own hands"
 flavour_nispac.4.t: "The Last Cry"
 flavour_nispac.4.d: "It has been a long period of recovery after the revolt, building up our forces, but we havent been the only ones doing so. In the shadows, the last remnants of old Nispac have been working to burn down what we have come to build."
 flavour_nispac.4.a: "Destroy them!"
 flavour_nispac.4.b: "WE STAND THIS ILLEGITIMATE CYCLE NO MORE!"
