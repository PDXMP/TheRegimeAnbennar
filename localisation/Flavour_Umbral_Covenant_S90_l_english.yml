 S90_dearest_family_title: "Dearest Family"
 S90_dearest_family_desc: "From Mama Hireet: the meaning of power, and how it may be wielded. From Auntie Komina: the taste of the moment the room shifts in one’s favour. From Granny Ilfa: that the world is an ever-receding cascade of secrets, silhouettes subsiding into the gloom.\n\nFrom the Coven as a whole: how to trust and mistrust."

 S90_bound_by_fate_title: "Bound By Fate"
 S90_bound_by_fate_desc: "She will need to cast the entrails, of course. Inclined to agree with Granny Ilfa’s somewhat withering estimation of the magic of men, generally speaking of course… I do not need a popinjay. Must know how to read the dead. I can forgive a lack of immediate prophecy, such things are a dice roll. So long as she is not cringing and apologetic…"

 S90_sweet_suffering_title: "Sweet Suffering"
 S90_sweet_suffering_desc: "I watch the halfling weep, and I am watched in turn. There is a point, as his entrails spill out over the damp, moss-furred ground and he beats his fist and wails, that my pity turns to disgust. No longer do I feel the burn of desperation, hoping that he might be delivered from his misery and allowed to die. I am simply tired and cold and thinking of my bed, wondering when this awful exercise might be ended.\n\nIt is then that Mama Hireet smiles. “You are learning,” she says."

 S90_plunder_the_earth_title: "Plunder The Earth"
 S90_plunder_the_earth_desc: "Hireet sees me dancing in the weft of magic; she orders twenty push-ups. She will not let me finish an hour of study without a brisk walk. It is the only aspect of my education, usually Granny’s domain, in which she interferes. “You walk this plane, girl,” she says, in that low growl which forces me to lean in and listen. “You’re not to forget the flesh and the dirt.”"

 S90_tame_the_stars_title: "Tame The Stars"
 S90_tame_the_stars_desc: "The lizardfolk are older even than Granny Ilfa; she herself has never denied this. Only now, in the shadow of the spires, have I begun to truly contemplate what this means…"

 S90_of_knowledge_title: "Of Knowledge"
 S90_of_knowledge_desc: "We meet, as is our custom, under a new moon and the cover of shadow. Ilfanill asks me what knowledge I have to bring to our conclave, and for the first time in my life, I lie to her."

 S90_relics_of_the_storm_queens_title: "Relics Of The Storm Queens"
 S90_relics_of_the_storm_queens_desc: "The Three are beings of shadow, bound inexorably to the shadow plane. Curious, that they have never proven able to exert power over the storm-lashed crags of Akasik. There are places outside even Granny’s grasp, magic that even that greatest mistress of secrets could not tap. I might feel a sense of treachery, encroaching upon the place of her failures, were it not for her example - for she has always taught me that the limitations of others must not impede my progress."

 S90_a_fitting_seat_title: "A Fitting Seat"
 S90_a_fitting_seat_desc: "I am sat on a throne, my little legs dangling half a foot above the ground. Hireet on her horrid dais calls out: “What is the colour of the sky?” In unison, they answer: ‘Green, Mama Hireet! Purple, Mama Hireet! Red, Mama Hireet!’ We are deep in the heart of the shadow swamp; some of the young trolls here have never once seen the shades they recite. This, I understand, is power."

 S90_the_creeping_dark_title: "The Creeping Dark"
 S90_the_creeping_dark_desc: "I am ten, and I have never won at cards against Granny Ilfa. The games have become a hardship, an endless indictment of my incompetence. I lose every single hand, and Granny Ilfa criticises my play. It is not like when I do my spells, and she gives me her stern, precious nod of approval, for there I am unmatched. Today I am coldly furious; twenty-three hands in a row I have lost. Frustrated beyond belief, I repaint the faces of my cards with a twist of the arcane - I finally win! And I comprehend, for the very first time, the purpose of magic…"

 S90_an_offering_title: "An Offering"
 S90_an_offering_desc: "The swamp trolls walk willingly into the fire for my Mama Hireet, a pale-grey pillar of flame bleached by the shadow of the temple. Their screams wash over me just like the heat, and this, I have come to understand, is sacrifice. I note well that we witches do not ourselves walk into the flame - such is the case in all places where sacrifice is done. We offer the goat in lieu of ourselves."

 S90_what_rules_man_title: "What Rules Man"
 S90_what_rules_man_desc: "I have taken the form of a tall, tall Mengi man, towering. It is my little experiment; a little of Hireet’s sheer scale, a fair amount more of Komina’s beauty. I spin the little courtier, her braids fanning into a great cloud behind her head. It is my shape which pleases her, but also my smell. It is my movement which pleases her, but also the softness of my sleeve. Desire is simple and it is manifold."

 S90_reshape_the_state_title: "Reshape The State"
 S90_reshape_the_state_desc: "…replace the Chancellery chairs, the clerks are feeling back pain and ignoring it, it keeps catching at me. The crystal nodes are misaligned from row twenty-six through forty. I gave Una the sewage schematics yesterday, chase those up. I want to see those new Cannorian rifle designs before we even think about regimentation. I don’t like that fabric…"

 S90_of_life_title: "Of Life"
 S90_of_life_desc: "I sit at her side, bold Auntie Komina, and watch as she enraptures an entire court. What joy it is to play a role in her grand drama, feigned daughter of some exotic noblewoman, and smile shyly, the wallflower to her desert orchid! Fresh fish from the Jashar Inlet, palm wine from the north, and everywhere the aroma of cloves… "

 S90_of_faith_title: "Of Faith"
 S90_of_faith_desc: "We form a lattice at twilight. I and five hundred ritualists are bathed in the last hint of the day’s shadow, cast by the setting sun against my local tower. They are not chanting the name of my Mama, my Auntie, my Granny. They are chanting mine."

 S90_not_just_the_past_title: "Not Just The Past"
 S90_not_just_the_past_desc: "Mama, Auntie, Granny - they have achieved incredible things, worked magic unique among any of the records I can find. Yet it occurs to me, as I put in place my designs - have any of them done what I am about to do, on such a scale?"

 S90_hearts_and_minds_title: "Hearts And Minds"
 S90_hearts_and_minds_desc: "I sit by her side, and watch her change. She emerges as the Mengi ideal, long-limbed and proud, swathed in cotton cinched at the waist. Has anyone ever been so gorgeous? Behind her plump lips her teeth are rotting, but stoic Auntie Komina never shows her pain - this, too, I know, is part of beauty."

 S90_my_domain_title: "My Domain"
 S90_my_domain_desc: "Only now do I realise the sheer luxury of reserving a little time for oneself. Of course, the libraries and ritual rooms in which I toiled under grandmother’s exacting eye possessed their own storied grandeur, but I should like to wander my beautiful new gardens, if only for an hour or so…"

 S90_fueling_the_apocalypse_title: "Fueling The Apocalypse"
 S90_fueling_the_apocalypse_desc: "The Three have always professed contempt for emotion, which so readily reveals the self. Perhaps this is to be expected from beings of shadow; when shadow is illuminated, of course, it is vanquished. I, however, am more smoke than shadow. I am 	fog, which eats up the light. Is this why I have proven so effective an instrument of their will?"

 S90_beneath_my_heel_title: "Beneath My Heel"
 S90_beneath_my_heel_desc: "Ilfanill favours the clever, those who scheme and make their own fates. Komina favours the lovely, those who dazzle and invite envy. Hireet favours the strong, those who impose themselves on this world. I find that I favour many, and in many guises. Perhaps it is the folly of youth to favour the novel, the different… or perhaps it is my first independent wisdom."

 S90_mistress_of_the_arcane_title: "Mistress Of The Arcane"
 S90_mistress_of_the_arcane_desc: "“All the models - the Eight Schools of Cannor, the binary creeds of Fangaula, the chi-matrices of Haless - are aiming to measure only this.” Ilfanill’s smile is savage and gleeful. She watches me dance among the magics, not so much switching between frameworks as ignoring them entirely. I can feel a bead of sweat trailing down my temple and my muscles ache all over, but I do not stop. I do not want to stop."

 S90_of_soul_title: "Of Soul"
 S90_of_soul_desc: "I feel the greater part of a million lives, the shadow cast upon the plane by their very essence. They are the warp to my weft. When I dance, they move alongside me, and my presence in this plane is magnified hundredfold by their company. Mama, Auntie, Granny are beginning to perceive this, my growing shape… in recent times, I am not merely ‘girl’ to them, but Daughter."

 S90_dominion_title: "Dominion"
 S90_dominion_desc: "I meet Mama, Auntie, Granny in the quiet places of Sarhal, one after the other. They are not diminished since the time of my childhood; we have grown stronger together, and their presence is as majestic and terrible as it ever was. Yet I stand among them unbowed… I no longer fear their disapproval. Perhaps ours is the most commonplace of tragedies: that inevitable time when Daughter must come to truly recognise Mama, Auntie, Granny - not as concepts, but as mere women."

 S90_planar_union_title: "Planar Union"
 S90_planar_union_desc: "Most lives do not converge to a single point; when they do, one generally comprehends this only in hindsight. Yet I have known from my earliest days that such rules are different for me. Rulership, talent, mastery, diplomacy, courtesy; all such endeavours are mere fragments of my purpose. This thing I do now; this is simply what I am for."

 S90_the_end_title: "The End"
 S90_the_end_desc: "So few work the levers of the universe; so few are truly consequential. Your Granny Ilfa is proud! Not too much longer, my clever girl, and you may finally rest…"

 S90_my_cloak_of_midnight_title: "My Cloak Of Midnight"
 S90_my_cloak_of_midnight_desc: "A thread trails beyond my arm, a break in my linen. I follow it, deep far deep, the fabric flowing through my hands, chafing at the skin of my palms, slowly carving a deep, thin groove. Surely where the thread goes is an empty place? Surely I am chasing my thread into a void?\n\nJust beyond the point of the unbearable, I find where the thread goes. It goes into everything."

 S90_magic_title: "Magic"
 S90_magic_desc: "Other mages do not dance among the magic as I do; they do not breathe it. I watch them strain and struggle at their craft, perceiving their limits as grand hurdles over which to painstakingly clamber. The limits of my magic are instead as the lip of a pond, one over which I may flow at whichever moment I so choose. And yet… even the Three do not make their magic alone."

 S90_the_fog_descends_title: "The Fog Descends"
 S90_the_fog_descends_desc: "“A curious thing. Most curious.” I am perhaps eight. I look upon Granny Ilfa, and for a second I swear I see something in her expression I have never imagined… uncertainty. I tell her what she sees is my 	fog, with all the self-evident certainty of childhood. “I make the 	fog when I do magic,” I say, and shrug.\n\nI flinch when she looks at me next. But in a moment, she is my Granny again, and she offers me a rare smile. We soon find a use for the stuff, after all."

 S90_shadow_succor_title: "Shadow Succor"
 S90_shadow_succor_desc: "Another eighteen-hour day. In my chamber I finally sit, my feet aching, my body yearning to subside. It is then that the shadow arrives, welling up through the little thread which connects me to everything. I rise a moment later rejuvenated, and I am ready to work once more."

 S90_of_death_title: "Of Death"
 S90_of_death_desc: "Mama Hireet is sixteen feet tall as her axe swings heavy among the enemy. As I dance my own magic in her shadow, it seems for a moment that I can see the strings of pain and despair which surge from each soldier felled, feeding my Mama’s power. They are strangely beautiful, like crystal strands of blood… I mimic her rage, and find to my delight that the battle sustains me too."

 S90_of_the_veil_title: "Of The Veil"
 S90_of_the_veil_desc: "I expand; snatches of far Sarhal dwell in my dreams, neither nightmare nor reverie. I begin to wonder: is it possible to wear a continent? "

 S90_straight_to_the_source_title: "Straight To The Source"
 S90_straight_to_the_source_desc: "Bulwar, like Akasik, lies outside of the traditional domain of the hags. Here every major religion of settled civilisation exalts the light, deeply suspicious from long experience of the appeal of the trickster. Is this why my Auntie has never truly gotten a foothold there? I return again to the fog, which drinks the light and is not conquered. How is it that I possess weapons the Three do not?"

 S90_might_title: "Might"
 S90_might_desc: "“From such a high-ranking slave, you need competence, intelligence,” says Hireet, her voice a rough bark. ‘Such a slave must love you, then - the bond must supersede their sense. They must not merely heed but adore you… by whatever means you can muster, girl.’ Hireet sweeps her heavy gaze over my body - she is generally of the opinion that I need more meat on my bones. But even she can see the value in seduction, if one must resort to that."

 S90_the_unholy_title: "The Unholy"
 S90_the_unholy_desc: "The Coven numbers three. Hags have long made such promises to one another, binding their magics to one another in groups of up to thirteen. Beyond this sacred number, so I have learned, the nexus fractures. I draw together my ritualists into grand lattices of a hundred or more and I wonder: how is it that I am free of such limitations?"

 S90_my_endless_legions_title: "My Endless Legions"
 S90_my_endless_legions_desc: "My Mama Hireet once taught me that my armies should be the extension of my will: not a tool, but a limb. Perhaps I have taken this rather more literally than she intended."

 S90_the_realm_of_infernus_title: "The Realm Of Infernus"
 S90_the_realm_of_infernus_desc: "Mama Hireet has taught me well that unthinkable acts possess their own power; the awful and the awe-inspiring are siblings, not opposites. If I am to come to terms with what lies ahead of me, I must be willing to tear open the very flesh of this plane."

 S90_i_will_not_go_gentle_title: "I Will Not Go Gentle"
 S90_i_will_not_go_gentle_desc: "Perhaps Mama and Granny will never know how dearly I longed to be their Daughter - to stand as a fourth in their coven, an equal. Perhaps they will never understand that they have taught me the greatest of lessons! It is vital to realise when one is the sacrificial goat, not the priest. I am beginning to comprehend that look I have seen in so very many eyes - like those who have fallen before me, I would simply rather live…"

 S90_all_shall_love_me_title: "All Shall Love Me"
 S90_all_shall_love_me_desc: "I left them behind, my Mama, my Granny, my Auntie, and I feared above all things to be alone. But I will never be alone again. In place of a closed coven I will weave an ever-expanding lattice of souls; not some temporary ritual gathering but a permanent circle, myself its immutable core. I can feel my magic strengthening this continent, fixing it in place… I can do this for the entire world.\n\nSoon every conscious being will form one stitch of a great pattern of all-souls, encompassing and cradling the whole span of this plane. Do not fear, my children! My plane is saved, and none will ever threaten it again!"

flavor_umbral_covenant.1.t: "The Vile One"
flavor_umbral_covenant.1.d: "We enact this umbral covenant in the name of the Coven. We accept the inevitability that all shall be consumed by shadows. We embrace our destiny to be the ones who shall lead Sarhal to its fate.\n\nShe who will bring about the Day of Shadows. She who has been raised by you for this purpose and this purpose alone. She who shall lead us into our inevitable, accepting your rule over everywhere the light does not reach. Bestow on us your pawn."
flavor_umbral_covenant.1.a: "The Shadows Answered"
flavor_umbral_covenant.2.t: "The Vile One"
flavor_umbral_covenant.2.d: "A hooded messenger entered under the shadow of the Matriarch to deliver the rarest message of all to the swamp trolls. They were seeking an alliance with Yezel Mora. Normally the messenger would not leave the shadows alive, but this one had news that delighted the Coven: The Umbral Covenant has been signed. With it the Night Hags have released their most powerful pawn into the prime material plane: the Vile One. A being of terrifying power, raised by the Coven from when she was a child, she has been created as a tool to guide the people of Sarhal to assist in our end goal: full unification of the shadow plane with the prime material plane.\n\nWith Yezel Mora on one side and The Vile One on the other, soon all of Sarhal will fall beneath our shadow!"
flavor_umbral_covenant.2.a: "Together we shall bring suffering across Sarhal"
flavor_umbral_covenant.2.b: "Begone pawn, we need no “Vile One” to achieve our goals"
flavor_umbral_covenant.3.t: "Rejection"
flavor_umbral_covenant.3.d: "A pawn exists to be sacrificed. So goes the message from the Coven. But no matter. The Vile One has her own plans for how to bring the realm of shadows to this plane. We need no hags to achieve her grand designs."
flavor_umbral_covenant.3.a: "We go alone"
umbral_alliance_tt: "We will seek an §Galliance§! with §YYezel Mora§!."
umbral_alliance_modifier: "Umbral Alliance"

flavor_umbral_covenant.4.t: "My Purpose"
flavor_umbral_covenant.4.d: "“You are potential. The one who opens the way.”\n\nThe voice is that of an elderly woman: Ilfanill, Granny Ilfa, Mastermind of the Coven of Yezel Mora, Wise One, Mentor to the Great, Secret Hoarder, Tutoress. Banish from your mind any notion of a schoolroom. The Vile One, a mere child, sits cross-legged in a sumptuous but austere study. This place does not belong to Ilfa - she has never built palaces. To Ilfa, such places are lent freely.\n\n“I am to sacrifice?” The Vile One says, “Sacrifice myself?”\n\nSharp child. Granny Ilfa gazes at her, her spindly limbs moving beneath her robes. Granny’s fingers are never quite right when she transforms - too many, or far too long. Each of the hags of Yezel Mora has such a tell, but for the little girl, seven fingers feels as normal as four.\n\n“Yes,” Granny says, going very still. “Sacrifice, and make us proud. Before the Planar Convergence is passed, your life will bring about Shadow, the ultimate knowledge of things, the coming-together of the universe. The first honest, conscious moment of creation. You will do something nobody else has ever imagined.”\n\nIt is an enormous burden, bluntly laden upon a child. The Vile One is not the only child to be offered such a future, not the first to crave Granny’s approval. But this child - this fierce, brilliant child - is the first to nod without hesitation.

Yet it is utterly incongruous, for this young woman is young, plump, not even so wise looking. Some upjumped village girl in worn sandals, with sweat stains under her armpits. There is a spot of blood on her neck which the girl has not bothered to wipe off.\n\nThe Vile One finds Herself smiling. There is more She must ask - She must find a way, quietly, to determine precisely just how far external magic can addle Divination, and She must learn this without admitting who it is She fears. All of these questions swirl around and around, in the half-hazy way Her thoughts run when She is concentrating on several things at once - there are so many to do! And yet, instead, the Vile One, Inheritrix of the Hags, asks -\n\n“Your name?”\n\n“Ikomeye,” says the young diviner, adjusting her wrapper. Her expression has not become any friendlier."

flavor_umbral_covenant.6.d: "In Her hands the Vile One grasps a small tetrahedron - a Genie relic, one of a type. This and others have been found in the ruins of ancient archives, plundered by Her agents; some open to conventional magic, others simply to curious touch. But this one is strange in two ways. First, it is too new. Second, it has remained stubbornly closed, and thus it fascinates Her. Any magic does, if it is sufficiently alien to the craft of the hags.\n\nThe relic is redolent with the Wish, the essence of Genie magic. It was not merely hidden, but protected. The Vile One can taste the layers of intent, of warding, of secrecy.\n\n“Cheni’s way will not work on that thing.”\n\nThe Vile One looks up, blinking. The voice is Ikomeye the Diviner’s, her matted hair loosely piled atop her head. It is never quite clear whether or not she has been sleeping. She kisses her teeth.\n\n“He is good at building things. At civilisation. That thing is something else. It is pure will, one-on-one, this magic. This magic is about… about saying the world is something, and then pop!” - she opens her clenched fist - “Things are as you say. Like how your Granny does it.”\n\nIkomeye pads across the floor, her bare feet thick with dirt on the sole. “I can hear you trying to open it all together… lattice, lattice, choir, choir.” She is mocking, though not cruelly. “No. You have to command it.”\n\nThe Vile One tries. Ikomeye cocks her head in disbelief. “Harder than that, kitame.”"

Only Cheni’s calm stops the rumbling. Sometimes Ikomeye joins her for a period of intent will - mostly she does not. It is a process of immense, tedious frustration, building and building and building until -\n\nAh!\n\n…for posterity the Dissipation and the end of my Masters upon Halann, I, remaining faithful servant of the Djinn, attest and record. Here amongst the dunes we build our refuge and await their return - few though we are, we are loyal. We armour ourselves in the dust winds, and since nought will grow above ground, subsist on what still grows in our Master’s old halls…\n\n...they approached from the north thousands-strong on their mounts, reviling us in their treachery, for they believe the Dissipation has made an end to the Genie-folk, but they were torn apart by the Ghost of the Genies, she who still mourns their demise, shrieking among the dunes…\n\n...We beg her passage over the sands, mourning with her as we play our flutes, and recognising a friend in our grief, she lets us pass, though she cannot speak but to bleed from her open mouth, noble Widow of the Wise..\n\n...not merely grief but passion too, our Kammen who is stoical matron and vengeful son both. He dances barefoot under the endless evening, Prince of Beauty, and weeps with us for the world lost beyond the endless Ash.

She leaves a cascade of light kisses on the Vile One’s cheek - it elicits an embarrassed smile, as it always does. Mama Hireet merely nods; she has hauled herself down, incongruously perching on a low wall. Granny Ilfa emerges last, as she tends to.\n\n“I’ve done well,” the Vile One announces. She learned as a child that praise from the Coven must be demanded. “Even now, my forces march unimpeded across Sarhal.”\n\n“You have not failed,” barks Hireet; the Vile One’s expression does not shift under the assault. It must not. Granny Ilfa waves a six-fingered hand in Hireet’s direction, irritable.\n\n“You have exceeded the pace I expected,” Granny says. A tight smile escapes the Vile One’s grasp; there is no greater praise than this from Ilfanill. “But yours is a life where demands, once met, only multiply.”\n\n“I know, Granny. I do not grow complacent.”\n\n“Oh, don’t bully her, you two.” Komina is on her feet, pacing, ever restless. Today she is a Baashidi beauty, high-cheekboned and almond-eyed, spindle-thin. “Her shadowmen are much tidier than any of your lot.”\n\nThe Vile One cracks a smile, quickly suppressed. Hireet and Komina descend into their bickering, as is their wont. But Granny Ilfa is quiet - always watching, always measuring."

She would pounce on this place, pace it, devour it if left to her own devices. The complex is not so flashy - repurposed from a barracks, it has been expanded upon to encompass an enormous space. It is austere yet verdant, offering shaded parade grounds for those corporeal soldiers the Covenant still employs.\n\nBut beside the long, low barracks buildings, there are offices. These are places where clerks will labour to bind the Covenant ever closer together, where they will identify and eliminate subversion. Clever Umorozi recognises that the direst threat to the Covenant is not its enemies but its traitors, and hers is an army whose spears will most often face inwards.\n\n“It is all as I suggested,” Umorozi says, her tone even and blank, but the Vile One laughs. Umorozi might as well be crying with joy.\n\n“Your ideas were sound, kitame, were they not?”"

She does not need to.\n\n“Forgotten who she is, the little bitch.” Mama Hireet’s voice is a growl; today she is a human, several feet too tall to be convincing. Mama wears a necklace of human ears. Such a berating is a ritual, the Vile One knows. It is to see if She will withstand it - if She will insist on Herself.\n\n“I have made something which functions,” the Vile One replies, swallowing the lump in Her throat. “Something useful to our cause.”\n\n“Fripperies!” Mama roars, stooping down, inches away - the volume is physically painful. “Poring over papers like a clerk! Fussing over aqueducts! Are you a mouse?”\n\n“I govern well,” She manages.\n\nHireet barks a laugh. “A governor, then! Useless girl - we raised an archmage!” Mama waves a hand at Granny. “A palace or two enough to make her fucking ordinary, after all we’ve done for her. Whiling away her time with her little playmates like some simpering sybarite…”\n\nGranny does not disagree.

flavor_umbral_covenant.11.d: "There was no city here before.\n\nTraditionally, the heart of this settlement was on the other side of the river, sprawled naturally in all directions. A warren of streets bloomed out from the three central markets, a complex spiderweb which clogged at random and mired the entire city in inefficiency and waste. No longer.\n\nRazing the entire temple district, the Vile One’s able administrators have built here an orderly array of dormitories and supply depots, brooded over by a large squat complex for any of Her mages that might be passing through. Access to such dormitories is dependent only on service to the Vile One Herself, untrammelled by any juvenile concerns of sex, ethnicity or species.\n\nSome have objected; this has proven inconsequential.\n\nHere, in the tidy stone settlement which Her dominion had built, the Vile One feasts. Her gaze passes over an array of smiling faces, enjoying the fruit of Her rule, the benefits of Her wisdom and authority. This place is richer than before She arrived; as General Umorozi ever intones, only the stupid resist betterment. \n\nFood and drink and treasure from a dozen places travel here unaccosted, for who would attack a supply caravan of hers? She finds herself reflecting; on the relative instability and volatility of the horde of Yezel Mora, on the stability which She has brought, where Her Granny and Mother and Auntie prefer purely to stoke discord.\n\nThe faces which look upon her in this most privileged of halls love Her, or at the very least respect Her.

Cheni merely grins.\n\n“We have fallen prey to the fallacy of proximity, kitame,” he says, in his silk-soft voice.\n\n“Have we now.”\n\nIf Cheni notices the sarcasm, he does not heed it. He is too eager to show his Vile One the precise measurements of the generous chamber, the bed recessed into one wall, the simplicity of the surfaces engraved with repeating, subtle geometric patterns.\n\n“It is a chamber designed for focus, kitame. The ceremony of ritual, hundreds of mages present, is all very well for our great works. But when we seek to bring another two hundred of your shadowmen into the world, must we meet so grandly? No, it undermines the thing.\n\n“Place a wall between us two,” Cheni gestures to indicate the wall, as he does when he teaches, “and we would not fail to communicate, no? We might even mindspeak more clearly, if we were both in a room without noise, without distraction.”\n\n“You want to keep them in here? The mages?” It is not a notion the Vile One dismisses out of hand - She is not afraid of incarceration. But Cheni laughs.\n\n“Not a prison, kitame! Merely a calm space, their space.

The girl finds such things natural, you see, and her mind wanders.\n\n“You are my cleverest one,” Granny says, one day. “You are a revelation,” she says, on another. The girl gives a triumphant little smile, but each day, inevitably she asks again. They are nourishing answers, but they are not enough - why are they not enough? “You are promise itself.” “You are a force.” “You are my good girl.”\n\nThe little girl trains and trains. There is a gap in her which she cannot see, a space over which she must only jump, and her Granny will praise her again. One day, she will repay her Granny everything; she will stand in the ritual circle as her equal and fulfil her role. Granny will not have to plan and fuss - everything will be at peace."

She imagines such an argument, Her Mama’s face bulging in rage, and for the first time in Her life, part of the Vile One thrills at the idea. The panic which follows quickly extinguishes the feeling - Her face does not move.\n\nNext there is Granny. As Coven and Covenant grow, the prospect of a final merging - the descent of shadow into this plane - becomes ever more real. It is the culmination of a millennium and a half of Granny’s planning, her foresight. It still fills her with awe, the span of her Granny’s mind, her cunning, her ability to conceal herself. Such control Granny Ilfa has, always.\n\nAnd then there is Komina.\n\nHow could She never have seen? Komina is different, always different. At summits like these Auntie barely speaks. Her expeditions have the tone of assignments; she does not dwell, as Mama and Granny do, on the stuff of shadow itself. All three of the Coven have metamorphic tells, of course, parts of their nature which show regardless of transformation. Granny’s long, extra fingers. Hireet’s sheer size. But Komina’s, the Vile One suddenly realises, is the only one to cause her real pain.\n\nSome part of Her, the Vile One realises, sought to join this Coven. Sought to make three into four, and stand beside them: Granny, Mother, Auntie, Daughter.

Granny hides it better, her will to see this done, but she too yearns - it is deep and pervasive and draining, even from across the clearing. The Vile One takes Her place outside the Coven circle; She is to be a feeder to the ritual, to channel Her entire essence into the grand lock of existence. It is what She was born for. Shadow will meet Material; the first true moment of existence will dawn. Mama Hireet and Granny Ilfanill will go home, and will take Auntie Komina with them.\n\nThe Vile One glances at Komina; if she has her doubts, Auntie does not show them. It builds slowly, the merging; all over Sarhal, the Vile One feels Her essence stir. Never before has She felt every part of her fog at once - never before has She felt this immensity. The ritual is of three by thirteen matrices, thirty-nine in total. The Vile One takes her place at the fourth. Cheni takes the fifteenth; Ikomeye mans the twenty-ninth.\n\nSo much of the infrastructure of this has been left to the Daughter, the dutiful sacrifice. She has built upon the ruins of Sarhal a continental framework of power, a lattice of incanters who follow Her loyally, who share as She does the fascination with great acts of magic. So many have pledged themselves to this strange shadow dawn. They fear death as any mortal, but they are willing to embrace it in Her name.\n\nThe Vile One glances at peaceful Cheni, pulsing calm into the shared ritual mindscape being built here. She glances at Ikomeye, who regards Hireet with a violent fascination. She is unwilling to see them die. She does not want them to die. They can not die.\n\nThe new moon has emptied the sky, and all the world drains out through it.\n\nThe Vile One hesitates - then She betrays. Thirty-six of the thirty-nine nodes of the ritual switch allegiance to Her instantly; they do not hesitate, for it is She to whom they owe their loyalty. Tears come to Her eyes. Though she is at the edge of things, she is suddenly the centre of the ritual. She remembers that favourite phrase of Cheni - ‘the fallacy of proximity’ - and She laughs, just once, disbelieving.\n\nThe flow of shadow magic turns towards Her. It is wrong; it is ungeometric. It is not how the ritual is supposed to work."

Surging with shadow magic, the Vile One instinctively throws up a wall of fog between Hireet and Her own ritualists.. Hireet lands a hammer blow on the wall with her bare fists, and the Vile One physically staggers. But her fog does not yield.\n\nThey have never understood the fog! Never been able to make it. The Vile One realises now; it is a substance both Shadow and Material. It belongs here in a way they do not.\n\n“Traitor!” Hireet bellows, and like a tug, the accusation seizes Hireet’s trolls, echoing for miles around. A tumult rises beyond the bleached trees, a roar of noise and rage. Hireet is the hag of tribalism, the one who identifies the enemy of the people. Her judgement is as good as command. The Vile One speaks into General Umorozi’s mind - ‘Defend yourself!’ - and simultaneously reaches for her shadow soldiers. She has to trust it will be enough.\n\nThe lattice of the ritual is broken; the immense surge of shadow magic, a pool infinite in depth and breadth, is already spreading and washing through the Vile One’s entire being, suffusing all Sarhal. She will not be so strong for long. The tide of power will equalise across Her span. She must get Her people out now.\n\nShe encompasses them in her strange fog, that which even the Coven cannot make. In this moment of sublime potency, She can carry each and every one of them together through the grey. And when She is done, She stands shrouded in the stuff, untouchable for a moment.\n\n“Ingrate! Useless, preening daughter!” Hireet is fury incarnate, three storeys tall. The Vile One finally wrenches her glance towards her Granny, who says nothing, merely watches. How She wishes She could be so circumspect, so wisely silent! But there is too much hatred in Her - perhaps She is too much like Her mother.\n\n“Never truly daughter, Hireet,” She says, her smile stiff. “I think we all know that, don’t we?”\n\nHireet snarls. “We will hunt you down, traitor bitch.

He nods vigorously. “The most beautiful thing in the world. Magic itself, of course, the feeling of it. But I mean magic with other people.

Big-big rituals, lots of people, like a coven or a tower…”\n\n“Yes.” The Vile One isn’t sure why She interrupts, or indeed why her voice is suddenly thick.\n\n“But here’s the thing,” Cheni says, and his smile softens. “You’re doing it all wrong. Or- well, competently. But -”\n\n“But what?” says the Vile One.\n\n“You’ve got to make it feel good for people. So they come back. And I don’t know why you break the lattice when you’re done with a single ritual. So wasteful.” He kisses his teeth. “You could make it permanent, see?

She is the tallest woman The Vile One has ever seen, outside of Mama Hireet in disguise. Mama’s size is her metamorphic tell; when she shapeshifts, she always becomes a giant thing, unwieldy compared to the norm.\n\nNot Umorozi. The Vile One feels a curious envy for those shiny arms, so wiry and muscled, which glimmer in the sunlight.\n\n“I don’t train?” She says, in the cold manner She reserves for audiences.\n\n“A leader must train. You are going to conquer the world. You are going to wake early every day to do that. You will not be weak.” Umorozi’s tone is prediction and command all at once - it is so much like Mama.\n\nThe Vile One laughs. “You are not my advisor yet.

The physical exertion of the rite is itself a balm; She pours her rage and grief into the movements, summoning and dismissing shifts of incanters to aid her work.\n\nUmorozi’s body helps; it is solid, memorial, something to reference, something to touch. Five times the Vile One wipes a strange drop of saltwater from Umorozi’s stomach before She realises it must be a tear. She seizes Umorozi’s spirit, yanks it back. There are arts, She knows, of fleshcraft and growth, wet with blood. What is done here will not be so crude or grotesque.\n\nThe wound in the stomach She closes in shadow - the breath of life is also returned in shadow. Hours pass. Then -\n\n“Kitame?” Umorozi says. The Vile One exhales, huffs relief - it is the endearment only three people have ever used for Her. More saltwater drops appear on Umorozi’s torso, heedless. The drops trickle down towards Umorozi’s sealed wound - now a line of grey-black fog, a strange unthing which confuses the eye. When the drops pass over the wound, they are swallowed completely."
flavor_umbral_covenant.170.d.2: "When Umorozi comes back the second time, her voice, once honey and thunder, is made strange and hoarse. She is able to whisper halfway across a compound and be heard only by her intended listener. She can issue a command and it will sound in the ear of every soldier within three miles, though she has not called out. The ugly gash which cleft her jaw and throat is now a beautiful seam of silver-fog.\n\nUmorozi no longer much cares for dates, or sweet foods in general."
flavor_umbral_covenant.170.d.3: "When Umorozi comes back the third time, The Vile One makes for her a beautiful fog-hewn arm. Umorozi can throw a javelin clean across a battlefield; from the ground, she can inscribe symbols, messages, images in the sky. Nothing in that hand can be tugged from her grip.\n\nHer muscles do not glimmer in the sun any more. They defeat the light. When Umorozi walks through her Mistress’s fog, her arm disappears entirely."
flavor_umbral_covenant.170.d.4: "When Umorozi comes back the fourth time, she is limbless. The enemies of the Vile One know her on sight, of course, target her, tear at her or send assassins for her. Unable to remove or indeed damage the solid fog of her arm, her killer has instead carved out the flesh around it, as they have around Umorozi’s jaw-throat wound, her stomach wound. For good measure, for punishment, they have removed all the other limbs.\n\nDo they seek to place Umorozi beyond Her reach? Such a thing is not possible. Four limbs are forged, one for each time She has brought her general back."
flavor_umbral_covenant.170.d.5: "When Umorozi comes back the fifth time, she no longer requires food, drink or sleep. The enemies of the inevitable chose, this time, to cremate what remained of Umorozi’s body. They carved around and removed the fog-parts once more, perhaps burying or disenchanting them. The Vile One looks upon such efforts and laughs, for now she comprehends the power of memory.\n\nFour times before She has resurrected Umorozi, has learned and rebuilt her form. Not so much more difficult now, to build it again from nothing. No mortal death can reach the great general now. When Umorozi strikes from the endless fog, she is entirely invisible; her whisper can reach halfway across Sarhal, so long as she can conceptualise the recipient.\n\nHer tall frame still drinks light - look closely at the fog-form, and one can see the sway, gentle behind Umorozi’s back, of those long banded braids. The Vile One would never have forgotten those."
flavor_umbral_covenant.170.d.6: "Umorozi’s fog-form catches and drinks the light, defeats it. She rises once more from the resurrection bed, tugged back as formless smoke from some unknown place, reformed into a shape which is a memory.\n\n“You have made me immortal, kitame. It is no hardship.”"

Ikomeye merely shrugged. Then she gave the noble an insolent smile.\n\n“You see, Vile One! This upjumped village rat has no respect! She is-”\n\nHe stopped abruptly. For a moment one might have thought he had quailed at a glance from The Vile One, but noises still issued from him, indignant nasal squeaks. When he turned, half the court shuddered involuntarily, for his lips had been sewn shut. The seam which was his mouth glimmered in fogged silver as his squawks curdled to panic.\n\n“It is clear you can make no use of the villa in its current state,” said the Vile One, Her fingers drumming on the wooden arm of the throne. “Ikomeye, as High Diviner, is thus clearly much better placed to dispose of it. It is hereby requisitioned in her name.”"
flavor_umbral_covenant.18.a: "Ikomeye’s dark wisdoms go unquestioned."

# I am your Saviour
flavor_umbral_covenant.19.t: "I Am Your Saviour"
flavor_umbral_covenant.19.d: "What is this feeling, more than anything? It is… precarity.\n\nThe Coven is broken. Hireet is dead. The Shadowroot Matriarch, so terrible and so beautiful, pulses at the heart of the Vile One’s arcane lattice, her continental self. She is powerful, the most powerful being on Halann. But so many dead things have said the same at one time or another.\n\nShe gathers her friends. Fog-touched Umorozi stands sentinel; Ikomeye picks at a scab on her leg; Cheni nibbles at grapes. There is so much She wants to say. So much She has thought about.\n\n“There is no permanence to what we have done,” She confesses; these are the only people in the world to whom She could admit this. “My Granny, she is-”\n“Wily,” says Ikomeye, nodding, not looking up from her scab.\n“Dangerous,” agrees Umorozi.\n\nThe Vile One exhales, her smile small and relieved. “Nobody can hide as she does, do you understand? Her Coven is gone, but she thinks in millennia…. and it need not even be her. How many times in the history of Halann have new things emerged, unprecedented things? Things which will try to mangle this plane as she did. The world… it trends towards disunity, entropy, strife. It is not… it’s not-”\n\n“A lattice?” Cheni offers, amused. And then She knows; she sees Cheni does, too.\n“Is it even possible?” the Vile One says, softly. “On such a scale? Is it wise?” She is surprised to see the vehemence in Cheni’s face.\n“It is the next step,” he says, fervently. “It is ascension.”\n\n“What are you two on about?” Umorozi barks.\n\nIkomeye’s face is sour. She has understood, and she dislikes it. She has tolerated the bond they all have, the near-permanent lattice that allows them to communicate, to coordinate. But to open oneself up as in a mass ritual? Emotion passes both ways, always - true privacy, the kind that Ikomeye craves in her quiet places, is impossible.\n\n“A lattice of the whole world,” The Vile One says, finally. “Every soul, connected. No subversion, no quiet cancer at the fringe. Everyone together, safe - nobody abandoned, left to fester.”\n\nIkomeye looks up at that, a strange expression on her face."
flavor_umbral_covenant.19.a: "It is beautiful. It is the planet, together."

# and despair
flavor_umbral_covenant.20.t: "And Despair"
flavor_umbral_covenant.20.d: "What a terrible thing, to go unloved. It is a fate none of the Covenant will ever suffer again. \n\nAs the Vile One’s lattice expands, it connects near every living consciousness to every other. She sits at its centre, and all feel Her presence, for She is immense and powerful and perfect. Fret not - it is not a featureless spiderweb. Nobody is robbed of their talents or their daily joys. They simply know each other now, know Her.\n\nThey love Her, as Her closest disciples love Her, and-\n\n\n…do you feel that? It is the endless susurrus of new life, new souls connecting to the grand conscious matrix of Halann. Enjoyable, when one is at one’s daily work, to listen to the faint harmony of baby minds entering the Covenant. Of course there is the void as well, the minds of the dying - a lurching drop into nothingness in myriad places of this great weave. But you understand, don’t you? Not one of them dies alone.\n\nShe did that. She is there when you are tired, when you are lonely, when you doubt. You flag, and Her certainty fills you, and you push yourself on. It is hard to imagine not having such a wellspring from which to draw.\n\nWe will find the recalcitrant few soon enough, those left in the corners of this world. We will teach them what it is to know Her; what it is to find Umorozi in the weft and lean a little on the general’s strength. What it is to feel grief, and have Ikomeye as a companion in catharsis. What it is to hear Cheni’s gentle voice soothing us in our pain. Planets orbiting our Mistress’ star, they are Family now, ever-present as She is.\n\nMother? Wife? Sister? Lover? Perceive Her as you will."

# even you
flavor_umbral_covenant.21.t: "Even She"
flavor_umbral_covenant.21.d: "“I comprehend my mistake, now.”\n\nGranny Ilfa is a peasant woman. The white shawl gathers around her face, descends over the aged hands with their extra fingers. Whence has she appeared? How has she gained access to The Vile One’s most private sanctuary? It is no matter.\n\n“You do?” The Vile One speaks - Fulcrum and Heart of the World-Lattice, Fog-Mistress, Great Queen. Granddaughter.\n\n“You are of this plane,” Granny Ilfa says. “It is not possible to subvert such a thing… as I myself know. The fog… I should have seen it then. We belong to our places.”\n\nThere is a long silence. The Vile One stares at her. “All this, Granny? Two millennia? Just to go home?”\n\nIlfa’s eyes crinkle; she seems almost to move her arm, but then thinks better of it. “Of course, girl.”\n\nTime passes. When the attendants come to give coffee, they do not notice Ilfa at all; if they find the request for two servings odd, they do not question it. Have the two of them ever simply sat together this way, grandmother and granddaughter, in the dying light of the evening?\n\n“It is your type of cleverness, this Covenant.” Ilfa’s voice is cracked, as it always is, but it has never sounded so elderly. “A Covenant we made to empower you, a Covenant between us and the power-seekers of Sarhal… you have made of it a Covenant of your own. Between you and your… your subjects?”\n\n“My lattice. They are me.”\n\n“Mm.” Granny chuckles. “Clever-clever.”\n\nThey regard one another. The Vile One realises that She may never before have gazed so directly into her Granny’s eyes; they are truly alien, more so the longer one looks. The endless feather spread of Granny’s wrinkles is arresting; it is precious and delicate.\n\nThere is a world where, in some remote Sarhaly hamlet, the Vile One carries her ancient grandmother into the warm sun on the verandah. A world where she passes a wet cloth over her Granny’s forehead, and rocks her in her pain. But that world is not this one.\n\n“This thing you have made,” says Granny Ilfa. “It is deftly done.”"
flavor_umbral_covenant.21.a: "And then she is gone."

# vassalise - this needs loc for other players getting vassalised
flavor_umbral_covenant.22.t: "You Love The Vile One"
flavor_umbral_covenant.22.d: "It falls upon the court as a curtain, this understanding. Scraps of envy for the organisation and unity of the Covenant, felt at one time or another by a courtier or two, spread among the assembled. None of you forget your opposition to the Vile One, nor do you think your past selves unreasonable, exactly - you merely remember what you thought, and come to the intuitive agreement that it was wrong.\n\nWhat exactly are you fighting for? So that when the next end comes, the sentient peoples of Halann must each face it alone? So that everyone lives and fears and dies without a friend?\n\nDon’t you feel that? It is every other soul in this world, the mere reach of a thought away. If you’re ever again lonely, or you don’t know how to go on, they’ll be there."
flavor_umbral_covenant.22.a: "And so will She."

# Matricide
flavor_umbral_covenant.24.t: "Matricide"
flavor_umbral_covenant.24.d: "Mama Hireet is coming.\n\nA wall of defensive fog erupts from the ground before the Vile One, instinctive, trained so many years ago under Mama’s punishing drill. Notice anything during battle, the slightest thing out of place, and bring up your guard. It is a testament to Hireet’s mad, brutal genius that she could teach a girl of pure arcane expression the instincts of the warrior. It is Hireet’s nightmare contradiction - strategic genius and bottomless bloodlust, the brain and the liver.\n\nMama has grown powerful from death. This is the lesson so many have learned fighting her - that Hireet merely strengthens as her forces are butchered around her. She grows and grows, her shrill laughter pervading the battlefield as she swells into a giant. She is an avatar of hatred, of the sick thrill of revenge. By the time she and the Vile One meet, Mama is the size of a harpy roost.\n\n“Traitorous Bitch! Failure! Fat, Lazy Cow!” Mama’s eyes are bulging. How many children have known that rage, as they cowered against the kitchen wall? Despite everything, despite who and what She has become, the Vile One feels the abject terror of the disobedient child.\n\nBut only for a moment.\n\nShe crafts her Denial, wears it. Mothers such as these cannot feed on emptiness. The Vile One does not run, but walks - She lets the tears fall where they may. Hireet’s fury and misery beat against the indifferent grey fog swirling around Her. Cheni is with Her, his calm voice thrumming in a ritual room hundreds of miles away. He has mothered Her more than this thing ever has, and the thought makes Her smile.\n\nShe slides the obsidian dagger into Mama’s foot. This is not a battle fought physically, nor a complex unwinding of arcane bonds; what kills Hireet is the simple disdain of the act."
flavor_umbral_covenant.24.aa: "Goodbye, mother."

flavor_umbral_covenant.200.t: "In The Gloom"
flavor_umbral_covenant.200.d: "Once again, I expand.\n\nThere is the first rolling in of the fog, and then there is its presence, a blanket over the earth, an immense silence. It instills quiet, peace. It drinks the harshness of the sun and suffuses my subjects. The fog settles gently, caressing mud-brick and ankles and tree trunks, and I feel what it feels.\n\nOne cannot see more than a few feet through the fog. Whisper to oneself, consider treachery, subversion, and the fog drinks even that. You are muffled. You cannot know if your discontent is heard - not here. It is more than physical. I am clothing my realm in authority, in Queenly garb."
flavor_umbral_covenant.200.a: "Every new place my fog touches, I feel."

flavor_umbral_covenant.201.t: "The Finer Things In Life"
flavor_umbral_covenant.201.d: "Ikomeye is collapsing with laughter. It is a rare thing - the dread diviner is a terrifying spectre of the Court, ornery and difficult, often filthy and unkempt. She has absolutely lost it - she is barely hanging onto her seat.\n\nCheni looks up from his morsel of cheese, mock-offended. “It wasn’t a moan.”\n\n“Was a moan,” Ikomeye howls, “long-long moan, just as it hit your tongue.” Umorozi is hiding a low smile - she has chosen a Yamokian Eyib, which she dabs by the spoonful onto chili-bread. She has none of Cheni’s love for rotting Cannorian abominations.\n\nThey can’t help it. Ikomeye is so far gone that the momentum of her laughter takes them all with her; even the Vile One.\n\n“I am at peace with moaning for a Baempes,” Cheni says, loftily.\n\nUmorozi shakes her head. “You say this shit on purpose.”\n\nIt is only the four of them; they sit in the empty parlour of a palace, its dynasty extinguished. This absurd afternoon was Ikomeye’s idea, for she is ever the first to suggest indulgence, to revel in power, to enjoy revenge. As they drape themselves across the sumptuous couches of this place, they all feel like upstart village girls for a moment.\n\n“You have to try this,” Cheni says; he is motioning to the Vile One, to a table laden with every cheese made between Lorent and Arawkelin. It is Her power, after all, that has brought these things here.\n\nThe Vile One hesitates; Her smile is still there, fading like heat from forged metal, but She keeps herself back, She always does. Cheni does not brook such nonsense; he walks over and tugs Her by the arm, an astonishing liberty borne of familiarity."
flavor_umbral_covenant.201.a: "That day she tries a lovely smoked Tipney."

flavor_umbral_covenant.202.t: "The Shadows Seep"
flavor_umbral_covenant.202.d: "Reports pass daily between the Coven and the Vile One, to say nothing of quiet meetings held between Ilfanill, Hireet, Komina and Herself. Under lonely trees in the hidden places of Sarhal, the Vile One learns of the strength of Yezel Mora, its growing organisation. She thrills at the thought that she is vital to the cause, that she has helped her family grow strong."
flavor_umbral_covenant.202.a: "Yezel Mora’s strength only grows."

flavor_umbral_covenant.203.t: "The Shadows Surge"
flavor_umbral_covenant.203.d: "Coven and Covenant are ever more entwined; for all that the hags fed on the constant small-scale warfare conducted by their swamp troll horde, gorging themselves on misery, a stable ally has done great things for the extent of the Coven’s personal demesne. Yezel Mora turns its hueless gaze across yet more of Sarhal, and Granny, Mother, Aunty and Daughter come ever closer to their final act of shadow."
flavor_umbral_covenant.203.a: "Yezel Mora’s strength only grows."

flavor_umbral_covenant.204.t: "Darkness Deepens"
flavor_umbral_covenant.204.d: "It suffuses each meeting - Coven and Covenant meet, and the power of each is felt by the others, too much magic for a single glade, for the space beneath a single tree. It is deliciously uncomfortable to be around one another in such a state. Long have the swamp trolls lusted for grisly revenge upon a continent which despises them - finally, the hags have unleashed generations of such hatred, feeding on the carnage that results."
flavor_umbral_covenant.204.a: "Yezel Mora’s strength only grows."

flavor_umbral_covenant.250.t: "Discipline"
flavor_umbral_covenant.250.d: "The bird emerges from the black of night, from the corner of the Vile One’s chamber. It is a thing of shadow itself, and where its wings flap, it clears the Vile One’s fog.\n\nThe letter unfurls itself; there is no need to read it, for the words there inscribed are whispered directly into the Vile One’s mind, the voice of a Granny cold and absolute.\n\n“No disappointment to us still lives upon Halann, save one. Goodbye, stupid girl.”"
flavor_umbral_covenant.250.a: "You have invited the wrath of a Coven whole and entire."

flavor_umbral_covenant.300.t: "The False Spire"
flavor_umbral_covenant.300.d: "The zatsarya dotting Taneyas and beyond can be fashioned into useful reservoirs for the Vile One’s magic - this She has learned from Her experimentation with such places. Yet the spire at Shalazar has never hummed with precisely the same magic as the others. It is an aberration, a curiosity, one of many dozens of oddities the Vile One had thought to deal with in an idle moment, of which She has essentially none.\n\nNow, though, the mystery is resolved - in applying the prototype sundering techniques to the Shalazar zatsarya, the Vile One’s mages have discovered it to be a fake. Their sundering ritual has blown a whole four times the intended size into the edifice, for the stone of the Shalazar zatsarya is inferior to the near-impregnable zatsargakh of a real spire. The rubble around the hole has disappeared entirely - as the Vile One’s mages inspect their handiwork, they perceive that the stone of this spire is not truly material but a sort of arcane projection, made solid only through the working of magic.\n\nAs they cross the threshold, a voice rings out; in the quiet of fog-choked, occupied Shalazar, the echo is tremendous.\n\n“Many thanks for unknowingly lending me your sacred spire. You may retrieve it from its current location in the Plane of Earth… although I doubt even your kind can morph into something that can withstand its pressures. I hope you enjoyed this replica in the meantime.”\n\nYour kind…? A message intended for the lizardfolk, clearly. There is little time to process the declaration, because even as its echo fades, Earth Elementals pour forth from the hole we have gouged in the false zatsarya. It appears this little hoax has teeth."

aur_kes_akasik_S90: "Befouled Aur-Kes-Akasik"
aur_kes_akasik_S90_desc: "Steeped in the enervating fog of the Vile One, Aur-Kes-Akasik falls into gloom. The Coven of Yezel Mora were never quite able to hold dominion over this place or access its secrets, but the Vile One is of this plane and has co-opted its magic for Her own. Beyond Her access to the secrets buried within the great complex, which She will no doubt unravel in time, Aur-Kes-Akasik now serves as a major node of Her spreading arcane network, propagating Her fog across all Akasik."
S90_shattered_zatsarya: "Shattered Zatsarya"
S90_shattered_zatsarya_desc: "The spire which once stood in this spot has been repurposed for an entirely different use by the Vile One. Unable to discern its original purpose, She has taken the pure-zatsargakh core and fashioned from it a gigantic reservoir for ambient magic. The radiating energy of life itself is slowly gathered from the surrounding region, and it is possible to redirect this energy towards other such shattered zatsarya as the Vile One’s needs dictate. This place is now a wellspring of power for Her ever-evolving plans, wreathed in Her fog."

#reforms
the_vile_one_reform: "The Vile One"
the_vile_one_reform_desc: "Spread the fog! The Vile One approaches, and Her domain rolls ever onward. Reserving all power to Herself and a coterie of fanatically loyal direct delegates, the Vile One and Her lieutenants govern absolutely. Her state is conceptualised as a grand lattice with Herself at its very centre, and she is a figure of equal veneration and fear. "
the_vile_one_reform_razing: "The Vile One"
the_vile_one_reform_razing_desc: "The Vile One is not quite deified, but it is a close-run thing. All of society defers to Her position at the centre of a great lattice of souls, justified by Her immense power, ability, wisdom and intelligence. Pre-existing hierarchies have dissolved in favour of society-wide competition for the Vile One’s personal attention, approval and mentorship, while entire civilisations are slowly cannibalised to Her ends. The highest ambition of any individual is to be a part of Her privileged inner coterie, to have a more central position in this grand Covenant."
the_vile_one_reform_initial: "The Vile One"
the_vile_one_reform_initial_desc: "A mage of nigh-unrivalled talent, the Vile One wears the epithet with pride. Tutored directly by the patroness-hags of Yezel Mora, the Vile One has come of age as a terrifying force in her own right. Her state consists more or less directly of Herself and Her direct coterie, and though Her realm is fledgling, Her will is absolute. "

S90_umorozi_reform: "Umorozi"
S90_umorozi_reform_desc: "Observe that as the Vile One’s power grows, more and more of those who surround Her are mages - yet long-legged Umorozi, her long braids tightly braced in silver bands, remains. The first to understand that the greatest enemy of brilliance is not opposition but betrayal, dread Umorozi has devised thirty-three and more stratagems to undermine resistance and stamp out rebellion. Respecting above all the logic of power, Umorozi regards the rebel with simple disdain - for those who do not recognise the inevitable rise of Her Covenant are stupid, and the stupid earn death as their due."
S90_Cheni_reform: "Cheni"
S90_Cheni_reform_desc: "Those who have learned to fear the Vile One imagine an Umbral Tower ruled by fear and misery; not so. At the heart of the Covenant’s arcane lattice is the monkish Cheni, whose preternatural calm and organisational genius bolsters Her most privileged subjects, Her mages. The Vile One’s grandest magics are done in concert with nine-and-ninety fellow practitioners, for She is immensely skilled at guiding such large-scale arcane matrices. Cheni’s calm stills the quivering of nerves which builds as the ritual begins - his voice rings out beneath Hers, a soothing harmony."
S90_Ikomeye_reform: "Ikomeye"
S90_Ikomeye_reform_desc: "Do not disturb Ikomeye in the space reserved for her works. The diviner fills villa after villa with refuse and filth, surrounding herself with shadow and rot, gorging or starving or scarring or burning herself, smearing the walls in gore. Then she abruptly moves on, dispossessing a sixty-sixth landowner or so, mocking him in her village argot as he carries his belongings out before her. The physical extremes to which she lurches give her strange insight into the path the Vile One must take, and so she is prized. But what binds Ikomeye to this work? Is it the fierce love for the Vile One she obviously holds, or merely a vicious glee that for once, the village girl will not be the one to suffer?"

# SECRETS OF THE SPIRES - Magical Project 1

magic_project_umbral_covenant.1.t: "Monumental Mystery"
magic_project_umbral_covenant.1.d: "Ikomeye sits cross-legged upon a small dais, at the centre of a large pool. The surrounding courtyard is dressed granite, at least a thousand years old by the count of those who know a little of lizardfolk architecture. The zatsarya does not quite loom directly over this villa, but scramble onto the roof of what used to be the main residence and one can see it peeking over the trees. It seems the right place to think upon the issue.\n\n“A set of arcane reservoirs was my first thought,” says the Vile One. She is doing large, loping loops of the courtyard, skirting the lip of the pool. Bendbark gutters filled it with rainwater but a half hour ago - it was Ikomeye’s little project to restore this place, for she is always in need of a new home to ruin and she has a surprising knack for the mechanical. The lizardfolk labourers who fitted the new gutters have already beaten a hasty retreat for the evening, so she and the Vile One may discuss the matter in peace.\n\n“Reservoirs for magic?” Ikomeye scoffs. “Ornate for the purpose, aren’t they?”\n\n“The lizardfolk have never shied from the ornate.” The Vile One smiles, shakes her head. “No, it’s what I can feel. Something humming below the surface. Perhaps dismissing them as reservoirs is mere wishful thinking on my part.”\n\nIkomeye nods, catches the thread. “Because if something is humming, and the zatsarya are not mere reservoirs…”\n\nThe Vile One smiles. “... then they are still working towards some other, unknown purpose.”"
magic_project_umbral_covenant.1.a: "Such risks cannot be simply left to fester."

magic_project_umbral_covenant.2.t: "Unearthly"
magic_project_umbral_covenant.2.d: "Umorozi delivers bad news as she delivers any other - tonelessly and bluntly. The Vile One’s arcane council, which consists of the Vile One’s apprentice Cheni and a cluster of lower-ranking mages, looks on.\n\n“My expeditionary detachments have finished sorting through the naga libraries, domestic and foreign, to which we now have access. We hoped to find some record there of the substance from which the zatsarya were created, so we might understand how to interact with or otherwise manipulate the pillars. Despite the historical taboo regarding such discussion, even within naga ranks, we have discovered multiple records which refer to the sacred substance used in the pillars’ construction. These records name the substance ‘zatsargakh’.”\n\nThere is a long silence, punctuated only by the sound of Cheni quietly chuckling.\n\nOne of the mages, frowning profusely, pipes up from one corner of the room.\n\n“General Umorozi… um, Vile One,” - she offers a nervous little curtsey in both directions. “Forgive me, but - doesn’t that just mean ‘zatsarya stone’?”\n\nCheni’s mirth redoubles. The Vile One waves at him to shut up, but not with very much vigour.\n\n“Your suggestion, General Umorozi?”\n\nUmorozi shrugs, her braids slipping slightly over one shoulder. “Only one good way to find out how strong a wall is.”"
magic_project_umbral_covenant.2.a: "No need - we will adopt caution, and study from afar."
magic_project_umbral_covenant.2.b: "Test the substance against our explosives."
magic_project_umbral_covenant.2.c: "I will feel out its strength myself - magic upon magic."

magic_project_umbral_covenant.3.t: "Plumbing the Interior"
magic_project_umbral_covenant.3.dstudy: "“Dead paper,” scoffs Ikomeye, as she rifles through the reports. “Would have been better just to blow the place up.”\n\n“Next time, perhaps.” replies the Vile One, her mouth twitching. “Much neater to find a key.”\n\n“These fragments will work as sympathetic objects, if we simply wish to divine the layout of this place.” Ikomeye is holding one of them, turning it over in her palm.\n\n“Mapping it manually would require an army,” says the Vile One, “but…”\n\n“But divination of such an enormous structure will be onerous. It is beyond my craft alone, at least in any good time.” Ikomeye is guileless and direct in her assessment of all things, even her own talents.\n\n“And you, knowing the ancient pedigree of the lizard mages, are not stupid enough to walk those halls blind,” Ikomeye says, eyeing the jet-like gleam of the zatsargakh.\n\nThe Vile One smiles faintly. “Indeed, I am not.”"
magic_project_umbral_covenant.3.dexplode: "Ikomeye is excited; she wanders among the fragments of the zatsarya wall through which the Vile One’s troops, with much effort over many months, have finally blown a gate-sized hole. Taken from the site of the zatsarya itself, the wall fragments have been arranged for her inspection, her divinatory insight. Ikomeye always delights when things of great prestige are sullied - be they buildings or kingdoms, human or otherwise. It is her revenge against the powerful.\n\n“These fragments will work as sympathetic objects, if we simply wish to divine the layout of this place.” Ikomeye is holding one of them, turning it over in her palm.\n\n“Mapping it manually would require an army,” says the Vile One, “but…”\n\n“But divination of such an enormous structure will be onerous.

magic_project_umbral_covenant.3.devo: "Ikomeye is excited; she wanders among the fragments of the zatsarya wall through which the Vile One, at great effort, has carved a tunnel. Each fragment is a perfect cuboid, the whole lot of them forced concussively out of the zatsarya by a single wrenching tug weeks in the planning, then collected for display and for potential use. Even the masonry dust from the zatsargakh was yanked out with the blast, so as not to dirty the insides.\n\n“You were showing off, then,” Ikomeye says, kissing her teeth.\n\n“Perhaps a bit,” replies the Vile One.\n\n“These fragments will work as sympathetic objects, if we simply wish to divine the layout of this place.” Ikomeye is holding one of them, turning it over in her palm.\n\n“Mapping it manually would require an army,” says the Vile One, “but…”\n\n“But divination of such an enormous structure will be onerous.

magic_project_umbral_covenant.3.a: "I won’t risk you, kitame. Go carefully, with a team of your diviners."
magic_project_umbral_covenant.3.b: "But what are armies for, if not to be deployed."
magic_project_umbral_covenant.3.c: "Divination would be onerous for one of us, but not for both."

magic_project_umbral_covenant.4.dslow: "“It is magnificent,” Cheni says. Before him is an arcane projection of the entire zatsarya, a three-dimensional map of its layout. It does not bring clarity on the pillar’s purpose, precisely, but it points to traps, maps overall energy flow.\n\n“It is late and incomplete,” Ikomeye says, but she cannot hide a small smile at the compliment.\n\n“‘Reservoir’ is seeming less and less absurd a suggestion for its purpose.” Cheni is tracing one river of energy with a finger, following it towards a great central column of rock, perhaps a lodestone? The projection marks it as powerfully magical, so much so that even those without the gift feel their teeth ache when they approach. “At least for this part of the structure.”\n\n“It seems a little extreme, even for the ancient lizardfolk empire, to devote so enormous a structure merely to fill a reservoir.” The Vile One’s voice betrays a rare emotion for Her - frustration.\n\n“Perhaps the rest of the structure siphons magic from the air?” Cheni is as implacably mild as ever; it is admirable and very irritating. “Perhaps it feeds the reservoir?”\n\n“Best way to test a reservoir is to empty it,” Ikomeye says, picking at a tooth with her nail. “Unlife, maybe, anti-magic. Spring a leak in it.”\n\nCheni shakes his head. “I don’t favour the risk. Better to take a breath, consult the shadow, and look again with more wisdom.”"

magic_project_umbral_covenant.5.t: "The Device"
magic_project_umbral_covenant.5.da: "“It was an idea from one of our inner lattice mages, you see - the dissident naga we picked up, Shagtseza.” Cheni’s eyes twinkle with amusement; the soubriquet means ‘madness-lover’.\n\nHe indicates the table before him, on which stands a complex little tower in brass and wood, covered in deeply etched grooves. In one moment the entire system seems to resemble the bendbark gutters of a lizardfolk outdoor bath, flowing to the base of the tower - in the next, a many-branched tree, intersected at odd, harmonious random with metal. All the many varied channels and rods meet at the bottom, where a set of pipes, also in brass, are hung from slender threads.\n\n“It is a device the naga use to hone precision, you see. The device is essentially passive - the naga in question manipulates magic towards the top of the tower, the receivers, channelling the magic to the bottom with enough deftness that the pipes are stirred, and make music.” Cheni demonstrates, ringing out a vaguely Raheni sounding melody that only the Vile One seems to recognise. “One shows one’s aptitude by playing skilful tunes.”\n\nNobody speaks.\n\n“It’s what the zatsarya is doing, you see?” Cheni’s eyes are bright; it is a victory the Vile One recognises, a good little boy who has found the answer. Still, she must insist - “The point, Cheni?”\n\nHe nods rapidly. “The zatsarya is passive. It isn’t a self-running system that siphons magic from the air. It’s receiving the magic from elsewhere.”\n\nThe Vile One frowns. She is processing. “And so you suggest…?”\n\nCheni grins. “Do what the naga do - send magic back through it, and see where it goes.”"
magic_project_umbral_covenant.5.db: "“The portents pointed us back on ourselves, to a part which stands for the whole. That’s when I thought, well, perhaps the zatsarya design was repeated elsewhere.” Cheni’s expression is triumphant.\n\nHe indicates the table before him, on which stands a complex little tower in brass and wood, covered in deeply etched grooves.

magic_project_umbral_covenant.10.t: "The Bigger They Are"
magic_project_umbral_covenant.10.d: "When the Zatsarya ruptured, all four of them saw.\n\nUmorozi the General frowned; the pillar blew apart, great chunks of zatsargakh raining into the fog-gripped surrounds, and she was already stalking off to issue orders, to coordinate a response, to make sure no subjects of the Vile One trespassed upon the places where the strange stone landed. There was still a hope the stuff could be made again, its secrets unravelled for the fortresses of her mistress.\n\nIkomeye the Diviner grinned; she had come to know much of lizardfolk arrogance while studying the pillars, and had judged it much the same as that of her village elders so long ago, all now dead. Ikomeye was the first to realise the hatred this destruction would brew in every independent lizardfolk state on Halann, but she felt no fear - she exulted at the thought of their seething outrage, and had utter faith in her mistress.\n\nCheni the Apprentice gazed in awe; all moments of great magic stirred this in him, and he let the feeling of the magic, pulsing from so far away, wash over his skin and clothes. After a moment, he closed his eyes - he felt where the magic was going, up and away and out and partly down. Finally, it flowed into the solid core reservoir of the now destroyed pillar, where it might be of use to his mistress.\n\nThe Vile One merely stared - this was a failure, after all, the loss of a mystery. She had hoped to discover a secret her Grandmother knew not, and had learned in the end only how to destroy it. But as her eyes fell upon the now-exposed magical core of the zatsarya, she remembered perhaps the greatest wisdom of the hags - how to remain patient, how to endure a setback, how to cultivate a resource out of an apparent loss."
magic_project_umbral_covenant.10.a: "What it was is immaterial. It is now a reservoir."

# BORN OF ASHEN SKIES - Magical Project 2

magic_project_umbral_covenant.51.t: "The Weak Link"
magic_project_umbral_covenant.51.d: "“I don’t understand why you have fixated on this thing,” Cheni says, gazing at the Tetrahedron with faint distaste. He is in some ways more conservative than even the hags, for he sees little worth to magic outside the latticework, the ritual combining of magical power, which has become his and the Vile One’s specialty.\n\n“You are not a man of intuition,” the Vile One says.\n\n“I am not.”\n\n“I simply know there is something to this, something we can use to convince her.” Besides Cheni, there are few others the Vile One would bother to try persuading in this way - Ikomeye understands intuition intrinsically, and Umorozi does not care. “This device is the only object I have come across which confirms a different account of events than that of my Grandmother - the only object independent of the Coven’s control whose account I can be sure is sincere.”\n\nCheni gives her a kind, all-comprehending, insufferable look. “You would open this thing even if it did not help you prise Komina away. You’re just following your own rank curiosity.”\n\nThere is a pause. The Vile One allows a stiff nod.\n\n“Well, that I understand.”"
magic_project_umbral_covenant.51.a: "“Let’s get on with it, then.”"

magic_project_umbral_covenant.52.t: "The Lexical"
magic_project_umbral_covenant.52.d: "It is the first step - to identify a word.\n\nThere is no other metaphor, and it is inadequate. The Wish is a magical layer beneath language, the spoken command merely its vector. The Vile One could not simply dig up the words from some ancient dictionary and repeat them, hoping to invoke a result like some common incantation: the magic is inherently Genie. But she does not need to practice Genie-magic to defeat it.\n\nThe problem is doing so gently. Genie-magic has been countermanded before, undone and destroyed, but to do so without damaging the information within this Tetrahedron is a colossal task indeed. All depends on having something to give over to Komina. It is like trying to read the letters within a bound scroll without moving the paper…\n\nYet slowly, so slowly, there is progress. It is a form of conceptual magic, of parallel thought, which the Vile One has never truly attempted. In learning to hear the language of Genies, she does not learn to speak as Genies do.

magic_project_umbral_covenant.54.d: "They do not realise what has happened, at first.\n\nThe Vile One and Cheni have been in ritual communion for thirty-six hours straight. Even when they stop to eat or drink, they remain together. They have engaged in such ritual workings before - it is the lattice they refer to again and again, the meeting of minds as a fabric, nodes strengthened by their mutual weft.\n\nCheni asks, -Is that a lock?-, and the Vile One replies, -Yes.-\n\nThey are focused on the relic, the little Tetrahedron; it is suffused in the strange Wish-magic of the Genies. If Genie-magic is the expression of a word, then they are just beginning to perceive the shape of the letters, small details pertaining to the style of the font. And there is a syllable somewhere, a syllable that means lock...\n\nThey realise, suddenly, that their last words to each other were thoughts - that they are thinking to one another. Not in the manner of arcane telepathy or projection, to which they are perfectly used, but across a new membrane, a new connection that they only now perceive. They stare at one another. Cheni attempts to tug at the membrane, to sever it, and finds that he cannot.\n\nThey continue to stare. They are amazed. It is no effort at all to maintain their joint focus on the relic and still have this odd connection - the connection persists when Cheni leaves, and remains intact after weeks apart, no effort at all exerted in its maintenance. It is a true lattice, telepathy without effort, the permanent fusing of minds. Cheni is less afraid of it than the Vile One is.\n\nTheir focus on the Tetrahedron only intensifies; it reveals fragments, memories of Komina’s past, and the Vile One gathers them before she and Komina’s next meeting."

magic_project_umbral_covenant.55.d: "Ikomeye joins against her will. It is Cheni and the Vile One’s cruel trick.\n\nThey know Ikomeye will join their lattice, if they ask her to focus her mind on the Tetrahedron alongside the two of them for long enough. The peeling of secrets from the Tetrahedron, they have come to realise, is just as Ikomeye said: a matter of will, unstoppable and inevitable if one’s focus does not waver. The Genies, so Cheni theorises, were capable of concentrating a year of will into a moment of Wish. They were unlike other sentients, who to yearning must add effort and time to achieve what they wish. The Genies could yearn enough, and focus enough effort, and simply have things be so.\n\nThe Vile One cannot yearn so much alone. She needs the will of many - the will of the lattice.\n\nThus, Ikomeye, wilful girl, is next to join. She wanted herself out of her family of misery, wanted herself out of her backward little village, wanted herself into revenge, wanted herself to the side of the Vile One Herself.\n\nYet Ikomeye, in the end, does not get what she wants. After eighteen hours of focus, she feels the connection form exactly as it happens. The strange mental sinew forms between herself and Cheni and the Vile One, and at once her thoughts and feelings and memories flow away from her and back. She sees Cheni’s childhood, a placid fourth son refereeing boisterous older brothers, the magic that finally made anyone look at him for once. She sees the Vile One’s childhood, an endless impression of classrooms and training and striving. She looks at them, at their looks of profound pity, and she knows they can see her childhood too…\n\nIkomeye shrieks. She shrieks for so long that her voice cracks, and then she is fleeing out of the palace. Days and days she courses across the territory of the Vile One. No matter how far Ikomeye runs, she is a part of the lattice now, too. And despite her distress, her fierce will contributes to the unravelling of the Tetrahedron - the Vile One learns more to tell Komina."

Her pain is no longer felt alone; however maddening it is for her friends to understand her fully, it is also, somewhere buried deep within, a relief. Together, the Vile One and Cheni and she have almost unwound the entire Tetrahedron - unable to countermand or alter the Wish upon it, they have simply learned to read what it protects, peering through the layers of magic like well-cut glass.\n\nIkomeye insists on only one thing - that if they are all to be joined, Umorozi should be, too. It is her attempt at petty cruelty, at forcing upon Umorozi something which she will not like. She has misunderstood. Umorozi joins the lattice as willingly as she took on the fog, as willingly as she allowed the Vile One to remake her. Umorozi believes in the Vile One, and she is the first to form the bond voluntarily.\n\nA ticking over, a regular drum. This is how Umorozi thrums along the connection, what she gives to the network. Cheni is where peace lives, Ikomeye a place to scream, and Umorozi a place to work. They are a lattice of four.\n\nWith Umorozi’s discipline, their focus is ever-further honed. The last records of the Tetrahedron lie open to them all; they need merely be unravelled."

He dances barefoot under the endless evening, Prince of Beauty, and weeps with us for the world lost beyond the endless Ash. The great romantic, who knows all feeling as her dominion and all desire as his garden…-}\n\nKomina looks, and then she looks again. The tetrahedron hums; it sends its record as a thought, as speech, as a moment of imagination.\n\n“It is one of your names, Auntie. Untouched. And you are talked about alone.”\n\n“I am often talked about alone,” Komina sniffs, but it is a feint.\n\n“They do not call you hag. According to these people, you have no sisters. They say you are born of ash.”\n\n“I have passed as an only child in many places. And been referred to by many metaphors.”\n\n“But not there! And not with your name, Auntie!” The Vile One has gotten to her feet, agitated. “And you don’t remember it, do you?”\n\nAuntie Komina hesitates.\n\n“You told them you were coming here, yes? Your sisters in magic. You told them you would pretend to listen.” The Vile One makes a noise, exasperated. “I’m not offended, Auntie, I’d have done the same. Well this is what I’m offering: surprise them. Don’t tell them what I’ve shown you here. Pretend, the way you do, to be flighty and inconsequential. And count the lies, Auntie, just for a week or two…”\n\nKomina regards her evenly. “And the invitation, Niece?”\n\nThe Vile One, Daughter of the Coven, simply shrugs. “I have met so many of your friends, Auntie. I want you to meet a few of mine.”"
magic_project_umbral_covenant.53.db: "{- We ask our Kammen whence he comes, and she does not know; a curse upon him? Her memory stretches only into Ash, into that awful time.

We know this, for Nirakhet does not weep from the mouth… -}\n\n“I do not contest what it claims,” Komina says. “Merely what that means.”\n\n“That you had a self before them, a life, even… followers.” The Vile One does not say ‘loved ones’ - it is the sort of sentimentalism that would drive Komina into hiding.\n\n“Have you considered that it was worse?”\n\n“Not for you,” the Vile One says. “You dance among the courts, drink wine with kings. You really seek the same as Granny, the ending of pleasurable things, of this plane?”\n\n“You don’t?” Komina says it lightly, as she says everything - but she says it too quickly.\n\n“I am with you, Auntie,” the Vile One says. “I would not readily give up the courts.”\n\nAuntie waves her arm dismissively, a ripple of gauzy silk. She does not trust this, not really. She is humouring her Niece. But it is out of curiosity more than loyalty, at least.\n\n“You liked my friend,” the Vile One says. She doesn’t know why She thinks this is worth stating. Something about the possibility of true bonds with others, perhaps, for Komina has always readily made bonds. Alone among the hags, her victims are true friends, true paramours. Alone among the hags, there are some who leave her company unruined.\n\n“Well, these meetings aren’t boring,” Komina allows.

We do not flinch when his mouth bleeds; it bleeds for us…}\n\n“They told me I was one of them,” Komina says, after some stretch of silence. “Fey, or something close.”\n\nThe Vile One looks up, surprised.\n\n“You expected better disguises? Are not the deals familiar, the bargains? Other strong things merely impose themselves.” Komina is clearly pleased to have the upper hand on secrets; to have a point in the conversation where she is once again strong. She sips at her over-sweetened tea.\n\n“And so you were…”\n\n“Their little sister, as they told it. A similar-thing, a thing brought through when they came through.” Komina’s eyes narrow; her expression is sardonic. “Alone in my amnesia.” The Vile One gives her a sceptical look, and Komina laughs. “Have you ever seriously considered disproving one of Hireet’s obvious lies? How exactly would one go about that?”\n\nThe Vile One allows a small smile. And then they are laughing - at Mama and Granny, at the absurdity of a clandestine meeting hidden from two who have been told in advance it is happening; of the privacy they have somehow nevertheless maintained; of a tea break in a war in which the two of them are sworn to kill each other.\n\nBut it is not enough; the Vile One can see that. Komina does not truly imagine an existence without them.\n\n“You must introduce me to the other one,” Komina says, finally, as if it is small talk over breakfast. “You know…”"

magic_project_umbral_covenant.61.d: "Ikomeye invites them into her place of filth; the stench is magnificent. The walls are daubed in blood, the few windows boarded, the cracks in the boards sealed with tar. Ikomeye says it is sensory - she works best with disgust, with continually renewed rot, with the powerful sentient reflex to avoid the putrid and the fear of sheer darkness.\n\nToday, though, there is a lamp. Today she casts the portent bones.\n\nKomina is incongruous; she is a beautiful Mengi woman, willowy, her hair a cloud of finger coils. Innumerable bangles on each forearm glint in the light. Were one not to know she was one of the Wise Three, one might expect aristocratic revulsion. Instead Komina finds it all great fun; she hides her beady attention behind frivolity.\n\nIkomeye is in love with her in minutes, naturally. When she throws the bones, it seems to the Vile One that she puts rather too much theatricality into it.\n\n“The first portent is the clay figure.” Ikomeye begins, her voice deep and resonant. “Malleable, unformed, unfaced, it will change only if and when your thumb presses deep into its flesh. The clay figure embodies potential; it is the terrible responsibility and the wonderful privilege of influence.” Komina allows a faint smile.\n\n“The second portent is the tree.” Ikomeye keeps her diviner’s even tone; her face does not move. “The tree is the root, is the thing which emerges from the soil. Know our soil, and know who we are. We cannot escape the soil in which we grow.”\n\nIkomeye clears her throat. The smoke from the hattiatia censer is thick and choking, and she sways a little as she sits. “The third portent is the vulture. It represents opportunism, whim and fickle intent - the idle fancy of the powerful.”\n\nKomina eyes the Vile One. She asks, “which speaks to you most, Niece?”\n\nThis is the Vile One’s chance to connect with her Auntie, to win her over. She senses her answer matters to Komina."

magic_project_umbral_covenant.62.d: "The ritual begins at twilight. By now, Cheni is practiced in his own right at creating a lattice of twenty or thirty mages; the Vile One may attend to other business and join as Her schedule allows. She and Komina enjoy a light supper, and it is only as they enter the ritual chamber that Komina gives a faint frown.\n\n“Your magic has changed,” she says, raising her eyebrows. “You’re willing to risk me tasting it? Knowing it?”\n\n“A necessary expression of my sincerity,” replies the Vile One, as they sit cross-legged on the ground. Komina somehow manages to make this look elegant. “So you understand how the lattice feels.”\n\nShe and Cheni lead Komina in; it is not the full connection, not the persistent lattice which stretches between the Vile One and her closest companions. Today is merely practice, a demonstration; between them, the ritual mages map the lizard port of Teramzadai as it existed two hundred years previously. Once they are done, any single member of the ritual group will leave the room able to navigate the port like their hometown, reflexively and without conscious thought.\n\nKomina connects easily and eagerly; the Vile One’s Auntie has never had trouble adjusting to a new social set. Her presence in the lattice is vast and anarchic; it buffets at everyone else, like a brisk wind, like a long scream in the desert in the wake of disaster. But like a brisk wind, it is hale and restoring - Komina wakes everybody else up, demands their attention.\n\nWhen they are done, a few hours later, Komina cannot help but grin. It is as if she just ran a mile.\n\n“You liked it,” the Vile One says, perhaps a little triumphantly.\n\n“Of course I did. A lovely diversion.”\n\n“But…?”\n\n“Just that. A diversion.” Komina shrugs. “You have made something new here, an advance of a certain kind of magic - it is enjoyable and pleasurable to its practitioners. It builds your power and makes you great. Very well, I suppose.”\n\nKomina is standing; she is brushing herself down, preparing to leave. “I have never loved a weapon for the way it fires, as Hireet does, never caressed a cantrip in the manner of your Granny Ilfa. You have a lovely means, Niece - but to what end?”\n\nThis is the Vile One’s chance to connect with her Auntie, to win her over. She senses her answer matters to Komina."

magic_project_umbral_covenant.63.d: "“You are like me in some ways,” Komina says, as if it is only just occurring to her.\n\nThey sit on the upper terrace of a barrack house, and watch as fog-touched Umorozi commands an elite guard in their drills. Komina is in her element at times such as this; the sun gleams off of the jewellery at her throat, Fahvanosy in make, and she herself is perhaps the most ravishing halfling the Vile One has ever seen.\n\n“I am?” the Vile One asks.\n\n“You enjoy their company. Mortals, lesser things.”\n\n“I came from them.”\n\nKomina scoffs. “Briefly, perhaps. And not since your fog.”\n\nThe Vile One tries again. “They are useful.”\n\n“But that isn’t why,” Komina says, smiling. “No, you’re like me. You get something from mortals. Your Granny and your Mama, for all they dote on their favourites, could go into seclusion tomorrow without a moment’s thought.”\n\nWere the Vile One a different woman, she might wince at that. She remembers a little girl whose every waking moment was consumed with Granny’s approval. The thought that Granny could have left her any moment is troubling. But Komina is right, of course.\n\n“What is it, for you?” Komina is gazing intently at the Vile One; has She ever before felt the full brunt of Komina’s attention? It is no wonder that people overturn their lives for Her Auntie; that after a day they will kill their families for her, run away with her. That moment of freedom, of deciding upon a new life, is what Komina truly feeds upon.\n\n“What do you mean, Auntie?”\n\nKomina grins. “What do the mortals give you?”\n\nThis is the Vile One’s chance to connect with her Auntie, to win her over. She senses her answer matters to Komina."

Nowhere that will hurt you, Niece.”\n\nThey do not speak for long - it is not that sort of meeting. The Vile One has given Komina truth, and little else. The receding silhouette of the Vile One’s Auntie is a lonely one, swallowed up swiftly in the gloom."

Finely appointed?”\n\n“Of course,” replies her faithful Niece. “But there is always…”\n\n“No, I think not.” Komina’s expression is not unkind. “The bond you have with your friends is far too much like my sisters’.

The hidden note of bad breath, the sour under a gorgeous perfume. Both ultimately disguise the roiling beneath, the endless churning emotion of a poltergeist-daughter, born of the Day of Ashen Skies.\n\n“I can feel them,” Komina says, softly. “Your friends. Then I am part of your lattice now?”\n\nThe Vile One merely squeezes her shoulder - a confirmation, and a reminder that no words are needed.

In times of emergency, they have used the lattice to communicate in just such a way. But in recent days, as they have planned a lattice for the entire world, they have begun to mindspeak as a matter of course.\n\nThe Vile One’s response comes after a long pause. -They will be woven into the lattice eventually. Persuasion takes time.-\n\n-Yes, they will. But, as you say, persuasion takes time.- How strange and perfect it is, that Cheni conveys his faint smile, his enjoyment for notes of symmetry, even while mindspeaking. How wonderful their lattice is. The Vile One’s chest tightens.\n\n-It is a terrible equation,- Cheni continues, -whether to abandon such minds, simply cut them off. But it must be faced, kitame.

Yet where Ikomeye is in the weave is a tangled mire, a mess of impressions; the nightmare life she had before she joined the Vile One, that which fired her taste for vengeance, conveyed with every thought she transmits. Considering the unbearable lack of privacy, Ikomeye is holding up rather well.\n\n-It is not sentimental, Ikomeye; it’s a question of resource allocation.-\n\n-You have your shadow,- Ikomeye replies. -All conventional magical focus should be on expanding the lattice as quickly as possible; that is our aim here.-\n\n-We must survive while we do that.-\n\n-We will!- the Vile One receives a sense impression, Ikomeye clicking her tongue, gesturing. -You are lying to me - you forget I am part of your lattice now too, that I can see!

But only by reaching does she know - through the lattice, to think and speak with one another is to be together.

magic_project_umbral_covenant.105.d: "The lattice grows. Every day, new minds - new lives - join its vast, ineffable network.\n\nThe Vile One loses Herself among the new arrivals sometimes. She reaches into a baker, say, feels their distress. She maps their complex confusion at the loss of privacy, the profound strangeness of suddenly knowing one’s neighbour, one’s brother, so intimately that it hurts. Most resolve themselves to their new reality; the stabilising presence of the Vile One Herself, and of Cheni, provide handholds for this perverse new sense. Those whose horror becomes too pronounced are tugged back by the consensus, or by the presence of the Vile One Herself. Suicide, as such, simply no longer occurs to people as an option.\n\nShe discovers, to Her delight, that many lose themselves in exploration. They contact one another across the lattice of minds, synaptic sparks across the emergent all-brain of Sarhal. They move closer together in a space that is not space, stars clustering together in a galaxy which is not a galaxy. They do this as they press out the dough in the morning, as they walk to school, as they spar in the courtyard. The enormity of their mindspan is humbling, and yet the Vile One can take a little power from each little life, a shield for all-Halann.\n\nAt the heart of it all is Herself, a centre which is not a centre, a core which is also periphery. She suffuses everything, is everything. The only place her lattice-folk do not go is where the shadow lives, where dwell those grand hag-taught empowerments which made the establishment of this lattice possible in the first place. It is the only place left which is truly the Vile One, untouched and alone."

Though their brief, miserable exchanges speak of a necromancer, I can taste Ilfanill’s magic in their air, in the dead things that even now close in. Through the rift I can see that these dead things will swallow up the entire swamp in nightmare and fear, extending my Granny’s domain.\n\nI watch a child trip and fall; I watch her be left behind. Was she the daughter of someone already lost, her new guardian not quite dutiful enough to return for her? Or have even her parents been harried into unthinkable cruelty by the chemical logic of survival?"

It is the sort of half-place where my Granny Ilfa thrives, a place where one can slip through the conceptual cracks of reality. And yet this is the kind of exchange which has happened so many times before - Granny Ilfa with her long fingers takes a baby from the other woman, whose face is etched in grief.\n\nThis, too, is familiar – the grief of one who has sacrificed something to power which they can never retrieve.

The courtier is a handsome young man with a smile that does not show his teeth; he leans in close, a confidante. The Prince glances up at the colonnade before he responds.\n\n“You really think so?”\n“You can do anything, Dejen,” presses the courtier. “It is the place of the King to receive revelation others do not - to access wisdom others cannot. To rule unbeholden to the trivial concerns of the gentry.”\n“Even against their will?”\n“Especially then!” The courtier’s eyes flash. “You are no patsy, Dejen. You are the bravest man I have ever known. There is no place for doubt in one who seeks to do great things.”\n\nDejen looks to the colonnade at the other end of the courtyard; it is the open face of the palace, gazing out onto the hills of Simegasa.\n\n“You’re right,” Dejen says, and the Komina-courtier grins."

She is reminding them who they are. Hated, despised, dismissed as cultic salvages plying forbidden magics. “Wretched you are,” Hireet insists, in her cruel facsimile of honesty. “But wretched you need not remain.” With a sweep of her enormous arm she offers them Yetefesefi - the riches, the plunder.\n\nHer offer is as it always is: companionship, solidarity, the chance to be Us and not Them. I watch as the Echenka imagine a world in which some other folk lose, close to here, in which someone else feels the sickening crunch of the boot against their cheek, the pressure grinding their face into the soil. And I watch them yearn for it."

It is horribly beautiful; the man unfurls like a flower, a gift just for Komina from among the greatest of her lovers. Does this Odanchés, regal even among harpies, realise that behind the veils Komina wears, her teeth are rotting? That there is no moment Komina is not in a little pain?\n\nOf course not. Komina is irresistible, and one will follow her into death even if she is reluctant to allow a kiss. Komina laughs; my vision splits across a dozen raids. In each raid, Komina demands of her paramour that this ship or another be destroyed, its people dispossessed. I see the gleam of ambition in the Odanchés’ eye - that gleam existed before Komina came. It always does. The hags never ask a person to do something they have not mused upon, however briefly."

For all of his arcane power, his mastery, he is an utter mediocrity - this is easy to sense at a glance, though I am unsure how, exactly. Is it the way he keeps wringing his hands, the reluctance with which he accepts the reality in front of him? Ah, no…\n\nHe has lost control of his thralls. Without the Coven’s leased power, he has not the strength to hold them. I perceive rather than hear that his ensorcelled lieutenants will soon be upon this place - will tear him limb from limb for his violation of their sentient minds. Their footsteps are already echoing at my periphery, bearing down - perhaps the fool perceives this too. Will he escape from here, ply his dark arts elsewhere, build up his strength? I find, with the cold contempt of my Granny, that I do not care."

He was not convinced by the disguise for a moment, yet neither did he cower in fear. The bureaucrat’s new Granny was cleverer than his last, you see, and had a hundred-and-one clever suggestions for how an ambitious young man such as himself might rise in the Ministry’s ranks. He soon realised he had been waiting his whole life to meet someone like this - someone who would look upon problems and solutions the way he himself always had, someone who would recognise his cleverness, his promise, his unique insight.\n\nHe talked his Granny’s ear off! So many questions he had: how to get what one truly wants; how to bend a room to one’s will; how precisely to milk the venom of the nakshas, to import it from the lizard-lands without raising undue suspicion…"

Yet I cannot recall ever seeing my Granny Ilfanill sit at a table in such a way, thrashing out terms. Everyone seated here wears a form not their own, for opposite the hags sit the demons, those whom the gnolls willingly host in their rituals of fell fire. These demons are fellow players of the game of suffering, though of course not quite by the same rules.\n\nHow cordial they are! How decent! Komina distracts the room, attracts all the attention, while Granny Ilfa conducts the true negotiation. A detente is slowly struck which will burden Sarhal for centuries…"

flavor_umbral_covenant.1010.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\nThese strange gnolls resist the designs of Granny and Aunty both, shielded by the resourcefulness of their goddess. Their philosophy repels the logic of paranoia, for all may feed from the greatest among their number, and even the dead are not truly lost. The gnolls chew their fallen right there on the battlefield and forgive them their betrayals. I sense Granny’s frustration, the braying laughter of Hireet. For once, it is Mama who dispenses the wisdom… for some enemies will fall to nothing but simple violence. The Coven will need an army, Hireet repeats, and with gritted teeth, Granny accepts the lesson."

flavor_umbral_covenant.1011.t: "Dreksaret"
flavor_umbral_covenant.1011.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\nHireet is a harimari - enormous, ludicrously so, yet she is the only harimari these rural village elders have ever seen in person, and they have no reason to question her appearance. She explains, in her blunt terms, the awful truth. They can continue to observe the ancient regulations on Mengi slavery, the traditional Mogzeta system which raises the indentured above mere property, and they will lose. Their rival villages will grow fat and rich in comparison, and will eventually conquer them, making slaves of them all.\n\nOr, just like those fattened villages, they can embrace the practice of Shegde slavery: the trade of souls will be as mundane as that in silks. Hireet’s argument is irrefutable. It has the horrible, leaden feeling of a reality to which one simply must resolve oneself. She watches as each elder is crushed under it, watches as their resolve finally crumbles.\n\nThis is what morality counts for when survival is at stake. Hireet’s tiger-smile spreads."

flavor_umbral_covenant.1012.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\n…but the vision is confusing and doubled. A halfling king’s heart fails him; he collapses as he dictates a letter, his final breath rattling gently. At the same time, an assassin’s blade passes through the throat of a naga, far away in Taneyas. There is rioting. There is rage. At court, a halfling rails against the tyranny of the lizards. In Taneyas, the naga say nothing; they simply turn inward once again, disappointed but unsurprised by the barbarism of outsiders.\n\nBut wait, I think - the lizardfolk are famously amenable to the halflings, who are perhaps the only outsiders the naga consider true equals. I look again at the surroundings, the tapestries, the decoration on the stonework. How ancient is this? How many centuries earlier could Taneyas have opened to the Vyzemby, if not for these two untimely deaths?"

flavor_umbral_covenant.1013.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\nMy Mama Hireet is so rarely known for her subtlety. Yet as I watch, I see her magic gently tip the head of the river-spear; it flies as if possessed from the hand of the fisherman Lessish, cleanly impaling the neck of the merchant Jiazi. Hireet would scold me for presuming that anyone, even she, could truly foresee the blood feud that will result from this, so many hundreds of years in the unfurling. The art of the hag is not based on clairvoyance, but persistence; not on ensuring certainty, but exploiting every possible opportunity.\n\nAnd yet, for a moment, as a frantic Lessish gazes into Jiazi’s dying eyes, desperate to staunch the richer man’s flowing blood, I fancy that both men can see it. They know what nightmares will come of this; they mourn the future together, all the lives that will be lost from this, in those final seconds."

flavor_umbral_covenant.1014.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\nI watch my Auntie move among the addicts. Beyond the sickly sweet tang of the nazhyn I smell the ocean and the faint must of mould. I know with the certainty of a dream that Auntie had little personally to do with making this place, for mortals do not always need the touch of a temptress to succumb to their own desires. Yet like the gentle lady who meets those who drown themselves in liquid sweet, Komina feeds on their need and their relief. Where does the pain go, when we gorge ourselves on something wonderful? Into their stomachs, feeding their mana?"

flavor_umbral_covenant.1015.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\n“Tsishagya!” the naga councillor hisses, and I recognise the slur - the ‘madness of the one’. It is the greatest sin of the Anzalkatsa ruler, to become heedless of advice and tradition, convinced of the superiority of one’s own singular understanding. It is synonymous with tyranny and misrule. It is a taboo which will save this Empire from the machinations of my Granny.\n\nAcross the great stone hall I feel a constellation of powerful naga marshal their magic; the naga train together, of course, and are deeply familiar with the pooling of magic for mutual ends. One cannot accuse them of lacking solidarity; there is even the touch of the Coven about them. I watch in faint surprise and amusement as Granny calculates her odds - I see her slip into shadow, leaving her unsuspecting protégé at the mercy of his advisors.\n\nThe magic of the naga builds. Behind them I see the shadow of countless millennia, the ghosts of an ancient siblinghood of study and statecraft. Having generally dismissed the naga as a stuffy, self-serving lot, I must suddenly reckon with their heroism."

flavor_umbral_covenant.1016.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\nOnce, in childhood, I compared my grandmother to the vulture. She was pleased by the comparison. Now I watch her drift contentedly among the ruins of the city, replete as one who has just finished a great meal. She glows, my Granny - the web of wrinkles suffuses her paper-thin skin, and even six-fingered she is beautiful. She dances in the empty places, in the withering fug, in the grief of so many thousands dead. Sometimes, one need not wield a blade; it is enough to notice when the corpse begins to rot. The wisdom of the Coven is not merely in preparation, but in the grasping of opportunity."

flavor_umbral_covenant.1017.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\nIt is hopeless. The shadowtouched’s magic can not possibly hope to overcome my Granny, whose very being is suffused in the gloom. A housecat against a lion, a worm against a serpent. Why does the shadowtouched struggle so, when the cause is so hopeless?\n\nShe is no slacker, this one - I watch her draw on a magic honed over decades, channel it outward with the exactness of a scribe. She resists. Her magic tastes of early morning and exhaustion, of stretching oneself thin, of a code rigidly adhered to even as those around her offer only suspicion. Her whole life, people have hated this woman for what she can do, and yet she has never abandoned her responsibility to them, her creed. She is a heroine. She is deeply decent. And none of this helps her a jot.\n\nAs a child, my Auntie Komina always struck me as the hungriest of the Coven - her love of attention and adoration, her need for praise. But Granny in this moment is a yawning emptiness, a starvation. The shadowtouched’s magic simply drains away, and soon too does her life - but even in her last moments, she does not grant my Granny a meal of her fear."

flavor_umbral_covenant.1018.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\nA blanket of invisible death billows down the slopes of Junansuar, displaced by the sheer power of the grand ritual in the caldera lake. Silence settles upon two-and-twenty villages, and near every soul in the shadow of the volcano is snuffed out within minutes. Men and women pass in their sleep, the fug of unair stealing their breath noiselessly. Entire herds expire; every insect dies. In the morning, when Granny faintly perceives what her magic has inadvertently caused, she will wander these places as a spectre, curious. When the rare survivors stagger away from their villages, weak and disoriented, and the first visitors arriving for market discover a place where even the corpse-eaters have perished, their horror will sate her where these painless deaths did not."

flavor_umbral_covenant.1019.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\nI have so rarely watched Granny teach others. She is exacting, of course, but not a drillmaster, not in the manner of Hireet. She paces the room, shielding it from the senses of others in the palace. I see the hatred in young Dogbeda’s face, the eagerness to learn, the insistence that he simply will not be overlooked. It reminds me startlingly of myself.\n\nCan one call this smithing? The magic in the air is so heavy that it pulls at my focus; I am impressed by Dogbeda’s skill, his single-mindedness, his mastery of the necromantic arts. And yet it is that single-mindedness which dooms him. He does not see it. Just as he binds his brother’s soul to that first blade, the blade for which he feels such boundless envy, so too does Dogbeda bind his own soul to the second.\n\nShe has planned it this way, I see. These brother-swords, suffused in hatred for one another, will dance across ten generations of blood."
flavor_umbral_covenant.1019.a: "A clever trick, Granny."

flavor_umbral_covenant.1020.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\nI watch the young woman arrange the bodies, two small and one big, in a careful row. The stars are magnificent in the desert, and since she lacks the strength to bury them all, perhaps she wishes at least to give them a beautiful view. The only real trouble, of course, was her husband - she slipped him wine less diluted than normal, smiled at him as they lay down together, and cut his throat. The children were considerably easier. She never took to any of this. She told her mother, so many times, that she never would.\n\nHer magic is not developed, not potent, but it is enough to set fire to the corner of the tent, to watch it quickly go up in flames. A sense of utter relief suffuses her. The long nightmare is over. The young woman will miss none of these objects, none of these things; she watches the tent as it is slowly engulfed with flame. Eventually, she takes the hand of her lover, the traveller Komen. He has promised her travel beyond travel, the sights of all the world. There is something so shy and intriguing about his closed-lipped smile…"

I blink again. It is as if the other part of her, the hag, has been teased out like fat splitting from oil; it lies atop her in the weft of things, instead of being integral to her. What strange place is this? Where are we?\n\nI recognise the carvings on the wall from my studies; these are Storm Queen petroglyphs, stuff for which my Granny never had much regard. These are things I have learned about on my own time, since I left her exclusive tutelage. I suddenly realise Granny herself is staring, much as I am; she, too, is spellbound.\n\nShe is looking into a plane mirror - a thing which allows one to look, though not by any means as mundane as sight. What I have called staring is inadequate; it is a thing done in the language of magic. I know that she is looking somewhere I cannot see. That blindness is perplexing in itself.\n\nI perceive, gradually and suddenly, that she is inexpressibly sad. "

flavor_umbral_covenant.1022.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\nIlfanill’s robes brush the ground; no doubt she has an extra finger or two she would rather went unseen in the roadside taverns. This could be anywhere in the desert beyond the Sorrow, in that endless sea of sand, and it appears at first that there is nothing for miles around. Then Ilfanill makes a terse gesture. An entire dune shifts apologetically out of her way, and the tomb entrance is revealed.\n\nI watch as she paces before the entrance, frowning at something I cannot see. Her first attempt is a powerful, simple Unravelling. I feel the humming logic of her craft - I feel as it blithely and inexorably points out that this other magic - the Khet magic - should cease to exist now, please and thank you. The Khet magic remains. I frown at the same time Granny does; I have never witnessed her Unravelling fail.\n\nThree days pass in a moment. Granny does not hurry - she sits facing the tomb entrance, sometimes for hours at a time, before she tries her next incantation. No furious Khet arrives to challenge her - her talent for concealment remains, perhaps. Yet for all her apparent patience, I feel the congealing of her fury. And I know, a moment before she does, that she will leave unrewarded."

There is sand here; I bathe in it, throw coarse scoops of it across my thighs, grind the grains into my flesh. Anything to focus on, any sensation. Anything else! I ricochet; four days pass. The dunes call to me, heavy tombs under which to bury my corporeal form, a pressure to shape me. Weight, heaviness - I need both. I need anything which is not the scream; I think I might *be* the scream. I am torn open, a cacophony. It is all spilling out, the scream is spilling out, and I have to scoop it back in…\n\nDays, days, days, days. I realise I am beside the ocean. I realise I am beautiful. I have screamed myself hoarse, screamed my teeth rotten; it is an ache which suffuses my jaw, my skull. But it is something other than the scream, and that is itself a relief. Why can I not stop looking across the water? Why can I not stop looking west? What am I looking for?"
flavor_umbral_covenant.1023.a: "It hurts!"

flavor_umbral_covenant.1024.t: "Far Salahad"
flavor_umbral_covenant.1024.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\nThe boy’s steps are heavy and dull for a child so young. He is emaciated. Nevertheless he clambers up onto the outcrop, simply to be somewhere which is not the endless, miserable noise of the refugee camp. Nobody will admit that their people are dying - nobody will say anything but to parrot niceties about Surakel.\n\nSuch adult opinions in one so young, such cynicism. The gnolls hound them everywhere they go, and that fool Maqet’s ramblings convince him not a bit. Even his mother has become contemptible to him; endlessly crying as if she has lost all her sons, as if he is not still here right in front of her, as if he is no compensation at all. Sometimes he is scared of how much he hates her. He finds that he would rather starve in the quiet.\n\nHe shapes a lens or two in the air, refracting the harsh light of the sun; rainbows form in the air, more party trick than true craft. Yet it shows promise. When Komina approaches, a few moments from now, she will not pressure him. He will be the first to ask if she can take him away, for his clever gaze will notice the cleanness of her clothes, the uncanny elegance with which she moves. When she finally offers, he will readily abandon his people."
flavor_umbral_covenant.1024.a: "He will be cultivated."

flavor_umbral_covenant.1025.t: "Far Bulwar"
flavor_umbral_covenant.1025.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\nVertigo, brief and intense, for the empty wall on one side of the room peers over a steep drop. The perch is poorly lit and smells faintly of rot, but there is also a strange chemical tang over the top. It is the work of the harpy, of course, with her ill-fitting clothes and her lank, greasy hair. Granny has too many wings, but this only fires the harpy’s interest further.\n\n“I have something for you to Hunt,” Illfanill says, and the covetous gleam in the harpy’s eye is terrible indeed."
flavor_umbral_covenant.1025.a: "Illfanill loves to collect such avid seekers"

flavor_umbral_covenant.1051.t: "Bulwar Proper"
flavor_umbral_covenant.1051.d: "The rift opens… and I can see.\n\nTwo women stand silhouetted by the light of their own craft. Do they know how rare they are, these sisters? Even at a moment’s glance I can see my Granny’s gift of doubt will not reach them. The women have been rendered dull and insensate by their faith in Surael, and hand over all such quibbles to him. I see with the begrudging eyes of Hireet that the elder sister was better treated by their parents, yet never have these women allowed such injustice to breed resentment or chilly disregard. Mama can find no way in either, I see that too. Even Komina, freer of burdens, can convince them not a whit, for the pair exult in their duties, take pleasure in them. Their responsibilities give them meaning.\n\nWhat utter bores! There is nothing interesting about them at all; they would make terrible dinner guests. There is no purchase for the Coven here, and I watch Mama, Auntie, Granny reluctantly slip back into the dark."
flavor_umbral_covenant.1051.a: "No wonder they call Bulwar dull…"
