 flavour_speaking_memory.1.t:0 "Loss of Memory"
 flavour_speaking_memory.1.d:0 "Our Memory Speaker priests have a sacred duty to remember the stories of every member of our tribe, so that the dead may live forever so long as someone remembers them. Now, something terrible has happened - one of our priests has begun to lose their memory while still in the prime of life. Worse, it has been many years since they most recently went on a pilgrimage to tell their stories to the Dragon Turtles, whose immortality and perfect memories ensure that none whose tales are told to them will ever be lost. While senility is always a terrible tragedy, we now risk losing the stories of many of our recently deceased; consigning them to oblivion if we do not act fast."
 flavour_speaking_memory.1.a:0 "Speakers trade stories regularly. Gather and reconstruct what we can."
 flavour_speaking_memory.1.b:0 "If we hurry, we can tell the Turtles our stories before it's too late."

 flavour_speaking_memory.1.e:0 "Our speakers now write their stories, to ensure that none are lost."
 
 flavour_speaking_memory.2.t:0 "Vagaries of Memory"
 flavour_speaking_memory.2.d:0 "We hold regular festivals in conjunction with our neighbors to exchange the stories of the dead and ensure that none are lost. During a recent festival with [speaking_memory_argument.GetName], one of our Memory Speakers was telling a great tale about one of our distant ancestors when they were interrupted by a [speaking_memory_argument.GetAdjective] Memory Speaker. The foreign Speaker claims that our story is false - that they know it with critically different details. An argument ensued, and the festival ended on a sour note. This is a serious problem, since carrying the memories of the fallen is the greatest duty of our faith. So long as we remember them, they are safe from oblivion, but what happens if they are not remembered accurately? If we have misremembered this... what else might we have misremembered?"
 flavour_speaking_memory.2.a:0 "They are lying. They must be."
 flavour_speaking_memory.2.b:0 "Perhaps our version is wrong. Now that we know, we can correct it."
 flavour_speaking_memory.2.c:0 "Surely the Dragon Turtles remember the correct version. Ask them."
 flavour_speaking_memory.2.e:0 "Truth lies in the space between the tales. Together we shall find it."
 flavour_speaking_memory.2.f:0 "So long as we hold the essence of their memories they will live on."

 flavour_speaking_memory.3.d.5:0 "The expedition we sent to the Dragon Turtles regarding our argument with [speaking_memory_argument.GetName] has responded with their answer!\nThe Dragon Turtles have no memory of this story. Did some long lost Memory Speaker fail to pass the story on to them? Was the story created from nothing? Can the Turtles... forget? Surely not. Certainly not."
 flavour_speaking_memory.3.a:0 "Now we know the truth."
