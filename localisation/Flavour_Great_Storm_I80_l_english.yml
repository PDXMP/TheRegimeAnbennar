 I80_faltering_flicker_desc:0 "“Let’s assume that the caehnate of Green Flame will still exist once the Great Incursion fails. How will you deal with them, their conjurations? They can clearly not be left to their own devices, as they are a threat to centaurs and humans alike.”\n\n“I hadn’t really thought about that. I suppose they are not responsible for the ice bridge. Their shamans summoning these ‘things’ from their sickly, unholy glyphs instead…”\n\n“You could just take the tribe and destroy any remnants of whatever they summoned.”\n\n“That’s sensible, but…”\nThe centaur was visibly conflicted.\n“But missing out on a treasure trove of information regarding all things Magic, Magic that Irdaeos himself has gifted us, would be a major setback.”\n\n“How would you even manage to get it? Their ruler would burn up in his green flame, along with any knowledge that he possesses.”\n\n“That just means that we need to incapacitate him until we can make him ‘amenable’.”\n\n“A poisoning. Not very honorable."\n\nThat remark was not worth responding to."

Tell me what the shamans should do after they consult the winds.”\n\n“I- They will create a network of sorts after I have secured their loyalty.”\n\n“Elaborate.”\n\n“A system of understanding. A way to better siphon magic. A way to set up a network capable of controlling the winds. Maybe in 5 years or so I could-”\n\n“You make it sound so simple, caehn. This could very well take decades.”\n\n“I’m certain I can shave that down by a good amount. And then we can begin harnessing the winds themselves after that.”\n\nAmbition."

His expedition torn apart, he alone remained. For his mastery of the Stormbringers domain failed when facing that very roc. The cold spread throughout his body, his skin tingling with the crackling lightning of the skies.’\nYou are not very original, Vranulk.”\n\n“And you are very predictable. I say one little thing and you immediately feel the need to explain that it’s one of your stories.”\n\n“But trying to recreate the magic from my recountings might just be out of your reach.”\n\n“Can’t be that impossible if you can do it.”\n\nThey exchange a smile.\nThe sound of the faintest raindrop sizzling on burning embers can be heard.\nA sincere laugh follows thereafter."

Our greatest tool.”\n\n“Most of the shamans have left to join the incursion.”\n\n“True. But I am working quite hard to instill greater communal loyalty within the shamans of the caehnate. Some of them have told me that they can even ask the winds themselves for advice.”\n\n“‘To instill greater communal loyalty within the shamans of the caehnate’. Listen to how you sound. So verbose, so eloquent. So stuck up.”\n\nA moment passes in silence.\n\n“I’ll miss you.”\n\n“Our eventual death is simply a part of Irdaeos’ design. Please, don’t be sad.”\n\nSorrow."

In order to do so I’ll construct temples and-”\n\n“Temples? Permanent structures? How do you justify that?”\n\n“Well, the different tribes might need to move, but that just means that the temples are kept in shape by a circulating array of ordsiwyn.”\n\n“That’s- that feels wrong. But I can’t prove that it disrespects Irdaeos.”\n\n“So there is nothing wrong with the reasoning?”\n\n“I suppose so. And these temples are supposed to strengthen the faith, strengthen their devotion, I assume?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nBewilderment. A taboo broken."

To see the waves crash upon that thing, to see the strength of the elements at their peak! Guiding this vessel safely through the maelstrom that you yourself have summoned, being quicker than a centaur on its 4 hooves could ever be!”\n\n“You are making it sound much more dramatic than it needs to be.”\n\nThe caehn has shuffled near his lover.\n\n“Aha!

It seems to be going quite well for them at the moment.”\n\n“Their ice bridges are held in place by the shamans. Their forces will be cut off once those die. The lakemen know this, for their specialized hunters are actively targeting them.”\n\n“Smart.”\n\n“The subsidiary caehnate of Ruin Bringer will be the first one I’ll be targeting.

A place without want, where every desire would be fulfilled.\nLook upon the night sky and count the stars. Listen upon the voices whispering in the wind. Feed the messengers of Irdaeos on his earthly domain, as they will feed you in the heavenly paradise of Ik Magthaal.’”\n\n“Do you think you will go there?”\n\n“I do not think. I am certain of it. Certainty is my greatest tool. The Maslekhuga believe that their pointless endurance will lead them there, the Irdukhuga think that unbridled indulgence in wine and earthly matters will grant them entry. But I, we, know the truth. It is not hedonism, asceticism or, Irdaeos forbid, seeking death by combat that will lead us there, but understanding ourselves and the world around us.

I need to build a force that is capable of taking on all the misguided caehnates at the same time.”\n\n“And surely there are no ulterior motives to that.

 flavour_great_storm.1.d:0 "40 damned years.\n\nVranulk has been waiting. He saw the rise of the great caehnate of the Wild Hunt in his youth. Saw them pour into Nuzurbokh, promising the centaurs of his land glory, plunder and entry to Irdaeos' heavenly domain.\nHe detested them. They are nothing more than rabid hounds, seeking glory where there is none, killing people for no reason but to self-aggrandize. The Filustkhuga are nothing more than a broken people who detest the plains that they have been given by the Storm God himself. They spit on his gift, for which our ancestors have died.\nAnd he would be proven right. The Great Incursion was nothing more than a graveyard for those seeking an honourable death in battle, whatever that means.\n\n\nThe tent was already quite lively when the caehn entered it.\n\n'The raids against Ruin Bringer are very fruitful. Their area of control has been reduced to a sliver of its former self.'\n\n'What about the southern Filustkhuga? If we were to attack Ruin Bringer head on, even Crashing Wave might-'\n\n'-intervene? I do not care. They should still be disorganized enough to provide no meaningful resistance. In fact, why wouldn’t we welcome their interference? All Filustkhuga must repent for their crimes against centaurkind, no?'\n\n'Ordsikar Tholnuvalk, despite the Sochar ordsiwyns’ support we are still in a somewhat precarious position. Green Flame and its great shaman are still presenting a credible threat, and antagonizing half the centaurs of the plains seems not… ideal…'\n\n'And? Mobilize the shamans.

That man is taking something out of his coat. A letter. Two letters?\nThis has no precedence. It was usually a spokesperson of some kind, relaying their message. The caehn can read though. This is no problem. He is smart like that.\n\nHe breaks the seal of one and quickly skims the content. Nothing important.\nThe other letter is torn open.
