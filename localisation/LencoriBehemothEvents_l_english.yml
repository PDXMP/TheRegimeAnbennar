 lencori_behemoth.1.t: "The Duke's Outburst"
 lencori_behemoth.1.d: "Today has been an interesting day at court. Not because anything particularly important happened, no, but for the rumor [Root.Monarch.GetName] heard all day from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] courtesans and advisors. Allegedly, the duke of Deranne, drunk and angry, complained about the size of their warships, screaming at their Master of Sea that royal transport ships dwarfed the proud Derannic war vessels.\n\nWhile the verbal abuse they suffered may only be an exaggeration of the rumor-mill, the Master of Sea acted swiftly, Derannic pride being at stake (though some insist he did only to placate the duke and protect his position). He ordered the construction of a massive shipyard and engaged the Veline brothers, a pair of renown naval engineers calling Westport home. They worked fast and efficiently, drafting plans for the “Shipyard of Lament”, a massive structure allowing the construction of equally monumental warships, fittingly named Behemoths."
 lencori_behemoth.1.a: "These ships will help us dominate the sea"
 lencori_behemoth.1.b: "Has he lost his mind?"
 lencori_behemoth.1.c: "Why should we care for one man's absurdity ?"

 lencori_behemoth.2.t: "A Rare Sight"
 lencori_behemoth.2.d: "The harbor of Wineport is no stranger to large ships, but to call its most recent arrival “large” is akin to calling the local vineyards “adequate.” The colossal Migrant Ship Rhasdalanai, one of the homes of the ocean-wandering Sea Elves, has dropped anchor in the bay in order to resupply. Built millenia ago by the Precursors, the vessel has caused such a spectacle that visitors from across Lencenor have flocked to the city, hoping to catch a glimpse of this naval wonder before it once again disappears onto the high seas.\n\nAmong the many sightseers happened to be a few prominent members of our admiralty, and seeing such a gargantuan ship in person seems to have caused quite a stir among them. Even the largest of our military vessels look like ordinary fishing boats compared to one of the seaborne goliaths of the Remnant Fleet. While the Sea Elves themselves are unlikely to pose any threat, if any one of our rivals happened to get their hands on a ship of this magnitude, any hope of exerting a naval presence in Lencenor would be all but dead in the water. Our admiralty has started pressuring the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to do something about this potential threat, but what could we possibly do? There isn’t a single shipyard in Halann that could build a vessel anywhere close to as large as the Precursors could.\n\n...Well, perhaps there is. Lament, in Westport. While the Behemoths built there aren’t quite as large as the Rhasdalanai, they are still really, really big. The duke of Deranne might have been on to something after all."
 lencori_behemoth.2.a: "Maybe we judged it too harshly"
 lencori_behemoth.2.b: "Of course, we are right"
 lencori_behemoth.2.c: "Put the infrastructure to use immediately"
 lencori_behemoth.2.a_tt: "We should send our §Yspies to Westport§! or §Yseize the city§!. In the meantime, we should keep our §YNaval Tradition§! §Ghigh§!."
 lencori_behemoth.2.a_bonus_tt: "If we own §Y[101.GetName]§!:"

 lencori_behemoth.3.t: "The behemoth of the West"
 lencori_behemoth.3.d: "Second only to the Elven Migrant Ships, the Behemoths are the masterpiece of Derannic naval engineering. A gigantic warship, a floating citadel carrying tremendous firepower that made the few already built the fear of every Cannorian navy.\n\nOur recent acquisition of the vessel’s plan, thanks to the invaluable work of our agents, has revealed the secrets of the Behemoth construction. Specialized shipyards, and large amounts of resources will be needed, but soon the Behemoth will give us control of the sea."
 lencori_behemoth.3.a: "Uelos must weep, for his dominion is challenged!"
 lencori_behemoth.3.b: "Uelos must rejoice, for his faithful will dominate the seas!"

 lencori_behemoth.4.t: "The Tragedy of the Ivrandir"
 lencori_behemoth.4.d: "Long ago, hundreds of elven ships desperately set sail eastwards, fleeing the impending doom of the Day of Ashen Skies. Sadly, it seems that for some of them, the journey ended before it even began. Wrecked upon the northern shore of the isle of Ivrantir lies the island’s namesake, an ancient ruined Migrant Ship that was quickly recognized as the lost ship Ivrandir by elven archaeologists.\n\nFrom what has been surmised, the Ivrandir drifted off course during the initial panic and became separated from the rest of the Remnant Fleet in Uelos’ Lament, sailing blindly before eventually running aground on the shallow waters northeast of what is now Endralliande. The survivors on the boat would have been forced to sit and watch as the Ruin unfolded in front of them, far too unsheltered and close to the epicenter for any hope of survival. A number of millenia-old bones were discovered within the hull, and though they were far too long gone to be identifiable, they were given proper burials regardless.\n\nThough it is surprisingly intact for a ship of its age—a testament to the incredible engineering techniques of the Precursors—the Ivrandir is far too old and derelict to ever sail again. That being said, having such a well-preserved Migrant Ship in our possession will provide us with invaluable insight into the advanced shipbuilding processes used to create them. With the island under our control, in addition to significantly improving our naval construction techniques, we may be able to use what we have learned here to streamline the production of Behemoths."
 lencori_behemoth.4.a: "Study the Ivrandir"
 lencori_behemoth.4.a_tt: "We can now apply what we learn to the construction of §YBehemoths§!."

 # Estate Privileges
 estate_burghers_control_over_behemoth_shipyards: "Grant Control over the Shipyards"
 estate_burghers_control_over_behemoth_shipyards_desc: "Building big ships is a big responsibility, but it could also be big for business. Giving private interests in our country a monopoly over our Behemoth shipyards would make it a lot easier to maintain the necessary naval infrastructure, meaning we could support much more of them at the same time. The overhead fees might cost a bit more than before, but can you really put a price tag on naval security?"

 estate_burghers_behemoth_reinforced_hull: "Behemoth Reinforced Hulls"
 estate_burghers_behemoth_reinforced_hull_desc: "With all the investment we’ve put into ensuring our Behemoths rule the seas, it would be a bit embarrassing if any old rump state with an out-of-date galley could take one down with a few lucky shots. Our shipwrights have proposed a method of reinforcing the weakest points in the hull with iron bracers, ensuring our ships are significantly more durable without too much drawback. Offense is pointless without good defense, after all."
 estate_burghers_behemoth_commanders: "Behemoth Commanders"
 estate_burghers_behemoth_commanders_desc: "Size only matters if you know how to use it. If our Behemoths aren’t commanded by the best of the best, the limitless potential of our state-of-the-art navy will be all but squandered. The [root.GetNobilityName] is well-experienced when it comes to leadership; by giving them greater influence over the selection of admirals, we can ensure our big ships are commanded by leaders that loom even larger."
 estate_burghers_behemoth_armaments: "Behemoth Armaments"
 estate_burghers_behemoth_armaments_desc: "Considering the sheer size of the Behemoths, there’s not much reason why we should limit ourselves to using the same ordinary-sized cannons you could find on any old galleon. Our shipwrightshave proposed a new design for a significantly larger cannon specialized to Behemoths, allowing shots to tear through smaller ships like paper. Defense is pointless without good offense, after all."
 lencori_behemoth_priv_flag: "Lencori Behemoth Estate Privilege"
 estate_burghers_push_for_impressment: "Push for Impressment"
 estate_burghers_push_for_impressment_desc: "The colossal size of Behemoths mean an equally colossal crew is needed to make sure they sail properly. In practical terms, that means we need a lot more people in the navy than before. The [root.GetBurghersName] have suggested increasing the rate of impressment in cities with Behemoth shipyards, and have even offered to assist with this process."
