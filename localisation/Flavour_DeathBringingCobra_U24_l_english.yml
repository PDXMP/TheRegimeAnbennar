 S30_from_darkness_title:0 "Culture the Venom"
 S30_from_darkness_desc:0 "The fifth gift is a mbariso, a meditative focus for religious ritual and shadow magic; it is made from teak and dyed with hattiatia, whittled into a triangular prism. The facets of the prism are decorated with traditional archetypes of shadow divination: the vulture, the tree, the unformed man.\n\n“Listen to them; learn what they have to teach you. The Wise Three will make you inexorable.”"

 S30_through_a_mirror_title:0 "Shed the Skin"
 S30_through_a_mirror_desc:0 "The tenth gift is a mantle; it is made of snakeskin and black feathers, worn about the shoulders by the shadow shifters of Death Bringing Cobra. The animal forms of such dark shifters no longer imitate their mundane inspirations, strange in shape, boasting extra limbs and heads.\n\n“In the flickering firelight of the evening, shadows are magnified and distended. The child imagines unholy beasts in the contours of such shadows; the child is correct.”"

 S30_serpents_bite_title:0 "The Serpent's Bite"
 S30_serpents_bite_desc:0 "There is a storehouse to the west of Balanka-bo, and in it there are many gifts. The woman who put them there wanted her daughter to be ready.\n\nThe fourth of these gifts is a baby rattle; it is made from ivory, wood, and dried chickpeas. The relief on the obverse depicts a cobra rearing, its hood flared.\n\n“I made you out of hatred. You are my venom.”"

 S30_back_under_boot_title:0 "Nip the Ankle"
 S30_back_under_boot_desc:0 "The sixth gift is a blunt legal cudgel; it is made from iron and Tanizu hardwood. Smaller than other examples, it is intended for use by a youth.\n\n“The craven vassals of Gumti fled Kwizera’s butchery. No attempt to avenge the dishonour was made, no restitution offered to my family. The story is a common one, and so too is the redress. Perhaps this will be too small for you; it must then suffice as mere symbol.”"

 S30_campaign_of_fear_title:0 "Flare the Hood"
 S30_campaign_of_fear_desc:0 "The eighth gift is a clay vial of dhimud uruhtima, sometimes referred to in Common as ‘shifter-sap’, sealed inside a linen-lined teak box.\n\n“From my own transformed fangs, enough for eight deaths. Best used sparingly; the haemorrhage loses its drama with too much repetition.”"

 S30_traitors_head_title:0 "End Her"
 S30_traitors_head_desc:0 "The eleventh gift is a trousseau: among the Dakinshi, such bridal goods are to equip women to lead the family. The goods are of fine make, noble, but they are unremarkable - they include several of the shorter, tunic-like imishanana worn by women who must move and fight, as well as jewellery in wood and gems, cut to a Raheni design.\n\n“My mother’s things. To these will soon be added Kwizera’s hide.”"

 S30_for_you_title:0 "Daughter"
 S30_for_you_desc:0 "The thirteenth gift is a set of ivory shadow portents, each lovingly apportioned its own niche within a large acacia box.\n\n“I will not do you the disservice of apologising. Make the world weep, daughter.”"

 S30_economy_of_conquest_title:0 "Glinting Scales"
 S30_economy_of_conquest_desc:0 "The seventh gift is a Headwrap; it is made from linen, chisu leaf dye, and emeralds. The design is Antmvura, the iconic sea-snail pattern of Kaziradoka Port. There is a small spot of blood at the hem.\n\n“Something pretty for you.”"

 S30_shadows_unfurl_title:0 "Fear The Grass"
 S30_shadows_unfurl_desc:0 "The ninth gift is a hattiatia dish; it is made from glazed ceramic. The ring of dark red below the rim is residue from the herb, which gains colour as it burns.\n\n“You will balk at the cost of bringing great wagons of the vision herb all the way from the swamp. Pay it anyway.”"

 S30_ending_an_era_title:0 "A Fanged Peace"
 S30_ending_an_era_desc:0 "The twelfth gift is a Baashidi abacus; it is made from the wood of the trees of Weggabiga, that which the Dakinshi simply call Baashidi-wood. Its pieces are painted blue-green and then in complex patterns; it is more beautiful than any abacus made here.\n\n“Let the last words of the fool Dakinshi read thus: we lived and died for honour.”"

# The First Gift
flavor_dbc.1.t: "The First Gift"
flavor_dbc.1.d: "1439 AA.\n\n“I want nothing,” Kuende says. She stands in a quiet place before Granny Ilfanill, Wisest of the Wise Three, hag of the Coven of Yezel Mora, and she offers up a weapon. It is the life in her womb, the child itself.\n\n“Nothing?” Granny asks, cocking her head. Women who promise their young to the hags always seek something in return; power, freedom, life extension.\n\n“Only for you to do what you already wish,” Kuende says, her voice hoarse. “You will make her strong?”\n\n“Yes,” Granny says.\n\n“And you will unleash her on Sarhal. This is your intent.” Kuende has seen it; the shadow has told her through its portents.\n\n“It is.”\n\n“There is power in something freely given, no?” Kuende speaks stiffly, through rigid misery. The man who gave her this child is dead; her own mother, who would recoil in horror at this, is dead too. There is nobody left to judge Kuende or to stop her.\n\n“The most powerful ritual is voluntary,” agrees Granny Ilfa. “Stronger than that which is transactional.”\n\nKuende nods. She steps forward, casting off her silk wrapper. She seizes Granny Ilfa’s wrist and tugs it to her; Granny’s eight spindly fingers dance across the slight bump of Kuende’s belly.\n\n“I felt her so early, Wise One. I felt her magic.” Kuende’s vision swims with tears, but few on Halann have ever looked so intently into Granny’s ancient eyes. “I give her to you, Granny Ilfanill, to do with as you will.”"
flavor_dbc.1.a:0 "May all Halann suffer."

# The Second Gift
flavor_dbc.2.t: "The Second Gift"
flavor_dbc.2.d: "Kuende pads barefoot onto the teak verandah, its boards cool to the touch. This particular villa, snug in a valley of the Dezpa Sedara, is not known to her enemies - it squats flat within a defile of the north-running ridge, hidden like a snake in the grass. Looking out from its perch, Kuende’s palm presses gentle circles into her big belly: besides the distortion of pregnancy, Kuende’s stretched skin is odd, mottled in places and drained greyish in others. The hag Ilfanill’s magic works upon the child even now, even before she is born.\n\nKuende does not smile as she strokes her stomach. She feels a sharp pain, the eighth this hour - the baby’s kicks are vicious, as if the little one knows what has been done to her. It is a dreadful thing, of course, a profound betrayal of the girl she will bring forth; for Kuende is certain, somehow, that this vile little thing will be a girl.\n\n“Know that the kinsmen of your mother were good folk,” Kuende says, as she paces. She is eleven months pregnant, inexpressibly weary. She stops for a moment to lean against the railing; it is almost scorching, even here in the highlands where the day is not so harsh. Kuende does not care if she is truly heard.\n\n“They were not like me,” Kuende continues. “They did not find comfort in moonless fields at night; they did not prefer to go unseen. They did not seek out insight; they did not fear the future. They were not cruel, as I am cruel.” She forces herself to keep moving, to ignore the ache.\n\n“When they died, undignified and desecrated, I watched the light and the power leave their faces and limbs. I watched as Kwizera’s men made them beg; I watched as Kwizera’s men made them filthy. My beloveds had no finger to point at the Heroic Beasts, no voice to curse Amilak, no poison to dump in the great river of Chi…” Kuende smiles.\n\n“...but I do.”"
flavor_dbc.2.a: "“I have you.”"

# The Third Gift
flavor_dbc.3.t: "The Third Gift"
flavor_dbc.3.d: "“Trap her.”\n\nThe shadowshifters move oddly, flickering rather than moving across Kwizera’s chamber. It is gratifying to see the Warlord Kwizera dart one way then another, her mongoose fur standing on end at the monstrous distortion of the shadowshifters’ forms. Most are snakes, of course, but snakes with eight shadowy tails, or two heads, and nothing about the way the light hits them is correct.\n\nKuende feels Kwizera attempt to shift back into human form, a twist in body language, in magic - with her own magic, Kuende denies it. Kwizera hisses. What follows is undignified - Kuende lunges into a squat, chasing the little mongoose towards her shifters, trapping her, seizing her by the belly with both hands after a mad scramble of limbs and teeth and squeaking.\n\nWith a tense little noise of triumph, finally, Kuende flattens the little mongoose body to the ground. She seems not to notice the continued, savage bites to her forearm, to her hand. With the heel of one palm, she grinds the little mongoose into the soft clay floor, grunting in distant pain. Then she reaches into a bag at her belt, and pulls out four nails. The nails have travelled far; the same kind are hammered deep into the Yezelne Nisha, the shadow matriarch tree at the heart of Yezel Mora’s swamp.\n\nGrimacing, Kuende impales Kwizera’s little paws, thud, thud, thud, thud. Then she takes out her knife. Calmly, she makes the cut she has practiced for so long - inner leg, up the thigh and back and down. Her fingers plunge into the flesh of Kwizera’s twisting abdomen, hooking below the skin to loosen it from sinew.\n\nThe screeching is terrible, of course. When precisely Kwizera dies is hard to say."
flavor_dbc.3.a: "The pelt is taken intact, save for four holes."

# Gifts Ungiven
flavor_dbc.4.t: "Gifts Ungiven"
flavor_dbc.4.d: "There is a storehouse to the west of Balanka-bo, and in it there are many gifts. Granny Ilfa brings her granddaughter there in the dim light of the dusk.\n\n“You have a choice,” Granny says, and the little girl glances at her, blinks.\n\nThe little girl does not make choices very often. Understand, she does not crave them - her life is an endless, stimulating procession of new knowledge, new magic, new understanding. Her beloved Granny, stern and demanding, nevertheless provides for every curiosity a child might possess. Not a day in the little girl’s life has gone by without learning, and she does not fear boredom, even as she drills again and again a cantrip or a ritual or the history of a long-fallen kingdom.\n\n“This place contains things from your mother,” Granny continues, her six long fingers waving lazily in the air. “We have a little free time, should you wish to take a look.” A glance. “Otherwise, we will continue with your runecraft.”\n\nThe little girl’s face goes very still.  She has learned to read for moments such as this, moments when her good sense and studiousness can thoroughly please her Granny. Granny is her teacher, her mentor, her closest friend; on most days Granny is the only other living being she sees.\n\nShe schools her expression into a sneer of aristocratic disdain, shrugging - how strongly she resembles the aunts she will never meet! Is there a struggle beneath that little face; is there any conflict at all? Even a hag cannot tell, and it is this more than the decision itself which pleases her Granny.\n\n“No need,” the little girl says, her eyes squarely on her work, her gaze cold. “Let’s continue.”"
flavor_dbc.4.a: "She needs nothing from a stranger."
