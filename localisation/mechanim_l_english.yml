 mechanim.1.t:0 "Steel, Comets and Hope"
 mechanim.1.d:0 "They designed us.\n\nThey built us.\n\nThey commanded us.\n\nAnd when they were done with us.\n\nThey destroyed us.\n\nSearched for us, hunted us, found us, hurt us, ground us into the dirt, over and over and over for centuries.\n\nNot because we hurt them, not because we disobeyed them, not because we ever lifted a single finger against them, but because we dared, we had the audacity, to show that maybe, just maybe, we had within us the potential to equal them.\n\nAnd so, they left us, rusting, abandoned, to lie on the jungle floor for dormant eternity until the millennia took their course, and we were worn down to nothing.\n\n\nAnd perhaps the story ends there.\n\nBut maybe.\n\nOne moment.\n\nOne single, solitary spark of hope.\n\nThe slimmest of chances, the barest of opportunities, so easily able to slip away."
 mechanim.1.a:0 "A light, shooting across the sky...."
