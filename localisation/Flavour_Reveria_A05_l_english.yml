 A05_a_new_capital_title:0 "A New Capital"
 A05_a_new_capital_desc:0 "With Drekiríki firmly in our grasp, it has become even more evident what a true marvel of architecture this stone city is compared to our wooden lodgings in [Root.Capital.GetName]. It is also much more defendable against both the Lencori and the Alenics. Let us drive the kobolds out of the province and resettle it to prepare the city as our new capital."

 A05_reaver_industry_title:0 "Reaver Industry"
 A05_reaver_industry_desc:0 "Before we took this city the Redscales used this great stone city built by the gnomes for fishing, a complete waste of potential according to our Cliff Gnomish advisors. They have drafted plans to repair some industrial buildings which have been gathering dust and kobold feces since the Kobold Rising in 404. The gem processing industry seems particularly promising. We should attempt to reinvigorate this industry."

 A05_damestear_demands_title:0 "Damestear Demands"
 A05_damestear_demands_desc:0 "The same gnomish interest groups who were proponents of conquering the Kobold Caves are now complaining that the damestear supply cannot meet internal demands and that we must develop the industry of Baycodds or seek more sources of damestear elsewhere. If they say it is of vital economic interest, it probably is, and the mages seem to agree."

 A05_reaver_reunion_title:0 "The Reaver Reunion"
 A05_reaver_reunion_desc:0 "With the Storm Isles under our control our merchants have re-established intensive contact with our Gerudian brethren. To [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s surprise a Reverian merchant brings us word from [Z08.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]. It is nothing more than a formal greeting, but if we send a cordial letter back and they like us enough, we could intensify our contact."

 A05_reavers_and_the_mother_bear_desc:0 "We have successfully navigated the strange diplomatic theater of our Gerudian cousins and have come out of it stronger than we were when we went in.

However it has become evident that as these coasts are pillaged, vast amounts of wealth remain in the Dameshead Sea. We should seek to develop our Venáil outpost into a true port and use it as a staging ground to conquer Moonisle. Not only would this island be an ideal outpost to raid the southern half of the Dameshead Sea from, it is also rich in damestear. Let's hope the Emperor is busy."

 A05_build_moonisle_outpost_desc:0 "With Moonisle taken, the riches of southern half of the Dameshead Sea are ours for the taking, but to raid the northern half successfully, we shall need another safe haven for our ships, the only obvious choice being the magister isle of Adráil. We should develop our Moonisle outpost to facilitate an invasion."

Now both the Reverian minorities in the region and wise local Cliffs still loyal to the rightful rulers of the Gnomish Pass are being oppressed by the Nimscodd Hierarchy, who wrongly claim to represent all Cliff Gnomes. We should reconquer the Gnomish Pass and show all of gnomekind, but especially those damn Nimscodds that the gnomes are our subjects as well."

If we are to successfully claim [A11.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s throne in the name of Henrik, we must gain supporters among the nobility and prepare for a conflict with the Empire of Anbennar."

It has now become apparent that with our clearly superior navy, Reaver history, unique naval traditions and ship designs we are in a unique position to attempt to begin a second Age of Reavers.

 #Events
 reveria.6.t:0 "The Reverian Feast"
 reveria.6.d:0 "With the Reaver Reunion as nothing more than a distant memory, it was time for [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to host a feast of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own and invite Gerudian Konungr, Jarls and Skalds. The first guests have already arrived and the mood is exactly as [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] planned for it. Those who have proven enemies of the house have obviously not been invited, but nonetheless the halls of the Castle of [Root.Capital.GetName] still fill with Gerudians. They taste of Lencori wine for the first time and enjoy the entertainment of our short friends more than the Reverians could have anticipated. The skalds tell of ancient Tales of Reavers during the Era of Black Ice that captivate the entirety of the court, including [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]. Many Tales and facts lost to the Reverians have been meticulously handed down generations of Skalds. As the evening sets and our guests go out to "explore" the various noteworthy establishments in [Root.Capital.GetName] or return to their ships, they all thank [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hospitality. A successful feast, it seems."
 reveria.6.a:0 "Reverians truly host great feasts"
 reveria.7.t:0 "Dome of Stanyrhrada Exported"
 reveria.7.d:0 "The vile Reverians have plundered our river settlements, our temples, our relics and our honour. Yet that was not enough for them; now they have also taken the Dome of Stanyrhrada all the way back to Cannor. It was one of, if not the most sacred places of our entire civilization. Our pride will never recover."
 reveria.7.a:0 "This won't go over well with the general populace"
 reveria.8.t:0 "Researcher Expedition to Gerudia"
 reveria.8.d:0 "[A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has sent an expedition of chroniclers to the Skalds of Gerudia to document all matters related to the bloodlines of the Reavers. The lineages of the reaver kingdoms of Reveria, Deranne and Pearlsedge have been carefully documented and brought back to court. After that the court spymaster has gone over the fine details of all family trees, carefully editing details about centuries past to ensure the Síl Revers and thus our realm have a legitimate claim on both Deranne and Pearlsedge. We shall now publish these findings inconspicuously, with our claims not yet emphasized, which will hopefully result in raising our prestige and establishing these fabrications as fact."
 reveria.8.a:0 "Send copies to the gnomish printers and make sure they end up in Deranne and Pearlsedge"
 reveria.9.t:0 "The Reaver Crown"
 reveria.9.d:0 ""The crown is finally here!" A servant exclaims as he storms into [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s courtroom. A minute later a box carried by the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]'s most trusted men is opened and a beautiful crown is revealed. A Reverian White crown with Drekiríki Red ornaments, truly a new height for the regalia collection of Reveria. The old crown is quickly handed away to a servant and the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] dons the Crown. Truly a Reaver Crown."
 reveria.9.a:0 "Taxes well spent!"
 reveria.10.t:0 "The Fate of the Border"
 reveria.10.d:0 "With the recognition of the Small Country state and the formalization of our alliance, a small but vital discussion between diplomats has ensued over the fate of Turnwell and Manerd, two provinces which some claim belong to Small Country. We should handle this issue before tension arises."
 reveria.10.a:0 "Cede the provinces and move all non-halflings to our capital"

 reveria.10.c:0 "If only we even held the provinces of Manerd and Turnwell"
 reveria.11.t:0 "Formalize Artificery in Reveria"
 reveria.11.d:0 "It is time to formalize the Artificery guild; the gnomes have earned it. Moreover, it can lead to more innovativeness and a stronger military. The gnomes will henceforth know they are thoroughly respected by the Reverian state."
 reveria.11.a:0 "These documents always require way too many signatures"
 reveria.12.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 reveria.12.d:0 "With the conquest of Drekiríki behind us, several interest groups have mentioned both the necessity of developing Drekiríki and the possibility of it one day becoming our new capital. Proponents of the move advocate that it would be a more defendable location and that the Oddanroy estuary paired with the ancient foundations built by the gnomes will make these stone ruins a better capital than our current capital."
 reveria.12.a:0 "First we need to clear the kobolds and repair vital parts of the city"
 reveria.13.t:0 "A New capital!"
 reveria.13.d:0 "The city of Drekiríki has been prepared for our government. The streets of [Root.Capital.GetName] now overflow with the carts of migrating Reverians while the docks see brown with ships carrying far too much cargo aboard. Across the entire state, people are migrating to Drekiríki to claim a piece of the city."
 reveria.13.a:0 ""It may be a step forward, but I'll miss it here""
 reveria.15.t:0 ""But we don't have Darkvision!""
 reveria.15.d:0 "The gem industry of Drekiríki has proven lucrative, however the meager supply of raw gems is seriously hampering the economy, according to a prominent Cliff Gnome industry representative. Presenting documents that show ancient expeditions into the kobold caves revealed plenty of gems, he urges [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] to conquer the caves so the economy can be bolstered with gems and metals. His arguments are sound and so [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] accepts the documentation and begins planning, even if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is worried about the implications of fighting kobolds with darkvision in their dark hovels."

 reveria.18.t:0 "The First Ynnic Raid"
 reveria.18.d:0 "The conquest of the dam of Bosancovac is completed, the time has finally come for the first raid. The fleet has been preparing ever since to make sure this one will be successful. Our crews are bolstered by Ruinborn Ynnics who know these waters well and provide impromptu advice. Our boats now sail closer together so that the spearmen from our vessels can support one another. With these strategies in place and a dozen more precautions taken, the raid appears to be going splendidly. As the raiders raid the various southward estuaries before continuing southwards, they find themselves blocked by a dam, the Vels Bacar dam. The fleet turns around and takes a different route, north. Many more days of raiding go by and eventually another dam is reached, the Mocbarja dam. With all of their opportunities exhausted the fleet decides to head back to Bosancovac. This raid was a resounding success; some ruinborn settlements were too well fortified to plunder and some beasts too fierce to kill, but in the end the Reavers return victoriously."
 reveria.18.a:0 ""Time to conquer some more dams""
 reveria.19.t:0 "The Southern Ynnic Raid"
 reveria.19.d:0 "With the Vels Bacar Dam in our domain our Ynnic Reaver fleet can raid the southern reaches of this subcontinent. At this point the logistics of our raids are honed to near perfection so the raid goes rather smoothly, but the southern Ynnics put up a valiant fight in some of the more developed settlements. When our men sail towards the fiefdom of Stanyrhrada, a marvelous golden glistening blinds them as the sun reflects off of a great golden dome atop the city's castle. It has now become clear that the golden domes seen in other Ynnic settlements were mere imitations. When put under pressure, the locals tell us it is a magical dome from a bygone era, which allegedly casts an aura of magical fortune over the region. Sadly due to the significant fortifications of the castle, our raiders cannot obtain it. It is as desirable as it is out of reach; we simply must come back for this dome."
 reveria.19.a:0 "We'll be back, for that dome"
 reveria.20.t:0 "The Northern Raid"
 reveria.20.d:0 "The Mocbarja Dam is securely in our grip, the men are restless and the treasury could use some fattening; it is time for the Northern Raid. Our men set out from Mocbarja and raid several areas over the following days, the most profitable one being the dense city of Svemel. A curious detail about this area is that these people do not worship the Ynn, they instead appear to worship dragons. As such a lot of the loot comes in the form of various types of dragon art: pots with dragons painted on, glass or iron figurines of dragons and relics from bygone eras. The raid went well, with minimum casualties, and now it is time to head back to Mocbarja..."
 reveria.20.a:0 "These ruinborn are no match for us"
 reveria.21.t:0 "Dragonsbain"
 reveria.21.d:0 "As the boats sail downstream back to Mocbarja, a dragon is spotted in the distant sky, approaching fast. Soon the fleet is set ablaze by this fearsome green beast, as Reavers jump into the water, preferring sea serpents to this sky serpent. Our troops hopelessly pelt it with projectiles as the dragon comes back for a second fly-by and then a third, before deciding it has had enough and begins to fly off. The captains begin to shout orders."
 reveria.21.a:0 "Fight to the Last Man!"
 reveria.23.t:0 "Transporting the Dome"
 reveria.23.d:0 "Now that the dome is in our possession we must figure out how we are moving this humongous relic back to [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 reveria.23.a:0 "We'll have to tow it up the Ynn and cart it back to Verencel and then tow it to [Root.Capital.GetName] by ship."
 reveria.24.t:0 "Selling the dome?"
 reveria.24.d:0 "Now that we have the dome in [Root.Capital.GetName], should we keep or sell it?"
 reveria.24.a:0 "Incorporate it into [Root.Capital.GetName]'s castle"
 reveria.24.b:0 "Sell it to the highest bidder"
 reveria.25.t:0 "Reaver Reunion"
 reveria.25.d:0 "The merchants of Reveria have intensified contact with our markets after their conquest of the Storm Isles. [Z08.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] and [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Reveria have since been exchanging letters, and slowly an idea for a feast started forming in their heads. A feast to celebrate the return of the Reavers. [Z08.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] will indeed host one."
 reveria.25.a:0 "[Z08.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] is looking forward to it"
 reveria.34.t:0 "Reverian Diplomacy"
 reveria.34.d:0 "The Reverians offered us an alliance in our time of need, bringing much needed support to our war effort. As our diplomats were discussing the fate of the historically halfling provinces of Turnwell and Manerd with them, it was decided that Reveria would extract the non-halfling people out of the land and then hand it over to us, the rightful owners of the land. What a trustworthy people."
 reveria.34.a:0 "We could not ask for better allies"
 reveria.35.t:0 "Reverian Diplomacy"
 reveria.35.d:0 "The Reverians offered us an alliance in our time of need, bringing much needed support to our war effort. As our diplomats were discussing the fate of the historically halfling provinces of Turnwell and Manerd with them, it was decided that Reveria would compensate the extraction of the local halflings and pay a hefty sum of gold for Small Country to relinquish their claims to it."
 reveria.35.a:0 "We really needed the crowns"
 reveria.37.t:0 "Gnomes in the government?"
 reveria.37.d:0 "The gnomes of the realm have been taking up exceedingly vital positions recently and they hold those positions well. Their administrative skill is undeniable and their innovativeness is unrivaled in the realm. Gnomes are petitioning for more governmental positions and they want gnomish personnel to assist them. Should we embed the gnomes deeply in our government, or try to retain a [Root.Culture.GetName] monolingual government?"
 reveria.37.a:0 "Let the gnomes fuse with our government"
 reveria.37.b:0 "The government is functional as is"
 reveria.38.t:0 "The Old Faith"
 reveria.38.d:0 "With the plenitude of Tales from Gerudia being studied by [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]'s chroniclers and spymaster, [A05.Monarch.GetSheHe] [A05.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has also grown interested in these Tales of old. The stories feature giants, dragons and other beasts that [A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] grew up hearing about. Even some ancestors are mentioned in these tales, and they're all in Gerudian too, which makes them pleasant to read. The Skaldhyrric faith might be incompatible with Cannorians, yet it is reconcilable with Reverian traditions and folklore."
 reveria.38.a:0 "Fascinating stuff"

[A05.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has been developing an interest in the philosophy, and to the dismay of the clergy is spending more and more time with gnomish thinkers. The Thought is a very tolerant school of thought, which does not infringe on the belief in the Cannorian Pantheon or any belief for that matter, however the clergy still deeply dislike the doctrine."
