 #Mission Descriptions
 J74_delegation_beyond_title: "A Delegation Beyond"
 J74_delegation_beyond_desc: "“And Vaunsarlanbeg said: Hail, Caergarae! You seek freedom, but crash fruitlessly against the iron wall of Taychend, and go bloodied but unburdened to Nalne Prih, whilst your kin, languishing in brutal subjugation, still linger in the mortal world!\n\nAnd why? Because you ride alone! Stay your blade for now, make pact with the scattered children of Munazhlan! Only then may your jaguar-teeth sink deep into the enemy!”\n\n– Vaunsar Dzan, the Call of Vaunsarlanbeg"

 J74_route_title: "A New Route"
 J74_route_desc: "Caergaraen has always been allied with the disparate Chendhyan tribes that dance the edge of the Kaydhano. With the powers to our south growing in strength and hostility by the day, however, the need to safeguard our north, and the route across sand and lake-sea that connects us to our kin in the west, grows alongside it.\n\nSo, we must take the initiative, seize this new route in its entirety, and with our allies on the steppe, ride together to defend our home."

 J74_our_bastion_title: "Our Bastion"
 J74_our_bastion_desc: "“And Munazhlanbeg said: “Hark, liberated people! Freed of ancient bond by blood and battle, yea we come, to the Sanctuary of Assakadail! May these holy stones give us shelter from unseen eyes and sky-wrought storms, for our march is at an end!\n\nIn carved-hill and hidden-cove, we kneel in sacral reflection, so that we may emerge into the next, the dream of a world-perfected fully realised in the light of our minds!”\n\n– Intro to Kaemzhlaemat Munazhlan, the Pillars of Munakles"

 J74_waters_title: "Purifying Waters"
 J74_waters_desc: "The Taras’su Ervan, once the cradle of our people, is the lifeblood for the slavers of Clemetar and Empkeios, a vital trade route and the northern link between the Kheionai and Taychendi worlds. They send their barges, laden with living-cattle and Larankarha-grain – and the lake-pirates of Caergaraen surge from their hidden coves, and help those who can.\n\nIt’s not enough. Even as Narha Waterclaw gained her name raiding the slave-barges of the lake, her legendary feats did little to dent the trade – so Caergaraen must strike at the source. Clemetar must burn, and the Taras’su Ervan must be purified of the slavers’ taint."

 J74_offer_or_stick_title: "An Offer Or Stick"
 J74_offer_or_stick_desc: "In the 1200s, the advancing might of the Second Gophiran Empire represented an existential threat to the Chendhyans. The Caergarae, among others, believed that they should tackle their might head on. They rode out, struck against the garrisons of the Guaraddhi, slew the Gophiran crown prince Seronkar Sangamar – and invited a full scale invasion of the steppe.\n\nCaergaraen lost. Quickly. It was only the hero Vaunsarlanbeg, fresh off his conquest of the Mteibhar, who rode to the Chendhya’s salvation, with a message of unity for all Munazhlan’s folk; a steel-rule to meet Gophiran iron, and destroy it. Caergaraen has not forgotten his lesson: if the Chendhyans are to survive, they must be united: by sweet words, or the warrior’s sword."

 J74_holy_foundations_title: "Holy Foundations"
 J74_holy_foundations_desc: "On the holy foundations of Munazhlan’s words and ideals, on the tenets of Askaeorg – Dynamism, Freedom, Proactivism, Respect – many Uyr have arisen; ways of thinking, of adapting and recontextualising the old ways. Many are worthy, just, right.\n\nBut those of the Halkuraet, who have thrown themselves into the glory-seeking mania of the Taychendi? Those of the Raehaef, the Chainforgers who think enslaving non-Chendhyans is just? These Uyr debase the very name of the Chendhyans – and Caergaraen must not abide them.\n\nWe are the Chainbreakers. We are the Raehultaz. We will keep the faith of Munazhlan, and the flame of his sword – even if we must ride against our kin to do it."

 J74_stone_sword_title: "And A Stone For a Sword"
 J74_stone_sword_desc: "The great sanctuary at Assakadail, the Askalyn, has long been the sacred heart of the Chendhyan people. Within its walls lies the records and tales of the great Udmanbaeg of ages past, their many Uyrs – ways of thinking – engraved onto the relics of a riven world. In Munazhlan’s day, it was the shelter of the Devandic people – and today, it remains the sheath of his sword.\n\nThe ideals of our legendary progenitor still guide us, the green-fires of Saerasyar scouring the enemy from the Chendhya – and we assume leadership of the Chendhyan people, it is time to make that victory secure."

 J74_ride_or_die_title: "Ride Or Die"
 J74_ride_or_die_desc: "The Ezhudar of Caergaraen has made many mistakes over the years. Our recklessness has invited invasion, our stubbornness has courted strife and discord, our fanaticism has threatened isolation.\n\nBut through it all, we remain ourselves. We keep the light, we guide the way. With righteousness in our hearts, and Saerasyar, the Green-Flamed Sword of Munazhlan in our hand, we have ridden out against those who would enslave the Chendhyans.\n\nBut there is much to be done. On the borders, storm-clouds gather. War-drums beat. The banners of war unfurl, as Andeios once more looks to the Chendhya in fear and awe, and the great question reveals itself: ride, or die.\n\nWas our answer ever really in doubt?"

 J74_reclaim_title: "Reclamation Day"
 J74_reclaim_desc: "“And Narha said: Ride, Chendhyans– follow the Gaevtae, and don’t stop until you have a Bloodcloak bastard’s severed head in your jaguar’s jaw! These Taychendi have terrorised us for centuries – but their time is done! They cower in their fortresses, pretending to be afraid, while they ride out to enslave and brutalise and murder!\n\nWell, if they want to be scared, we’ll give them a real reason to be– and when we repay the ravages they’ve visited on us ten-thousand-fold, they won’t be pretending anymore! Liberation! Reclamation! To Rakkabuttai, Caergaraen– to war!”\n\n– Narha Dzan, the Call of the Waterclaw"

 J74_wayward_kin_title: "Wayward Kin"
 J74_wayward_kin_desc: "Though a city of foreign Taychendi on the steppe, Oremvand’s founding queen Taneliata made peace with the Chendhyans of Haebyziund, married their King, and welcomed his people into their city with open arms.\n\nBut through that partnership, Oremvand changed our kin. The Chendhyans first adopted the Taychendi way of thinking – the Halkuraet Uyr – and eventually made that final, unforgivable step: they enslaved other Chendhyans. They became Raehaef: Chainforgers.\n\nCaergaraen – Saerasyar – must not allow this to stand: we must turn our wayward kin back to the true path."

 #Events
 caergaraen.1.t: "The Sword Has Returned"
 caergaraen.1.d: "Unwisely used, the sacred Precursor spellblade Saerasyar, the Green-Flamed Sword, punishes its unworthy wielder in a mighty explosion of flame and magic, reappearing only when it has found a worthy member of Munazhlan’s folk to show itself to.\n\nYears after the untimely demise of our last ruler, Saerasyar has once more revealed itself, and it has been spirited away to the Askalyn at Assakadail. Should [Root.Monarch.GetName] wish to brave its effects, they can take up the sword once more."
 caergaraen.1.a: "The flame of freedom burns bright once more!"

 caergaraen.2.t: "Judging The Guilty"
 caergaraen.2.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] advanced on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] defeated enemy, Saerasyar in hand. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] foe scurried away, held an arm over their head, pleaded for mercy. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] did not give it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] held the burning blade high, then brought it down.\n\nBut Saerasyar refused.\n\nThe blade erupted into a roiling blast of light and fire and magic, and the room to howling screams. The to-be-executed was reduced to a mutilated, charred husk, as the explosion knocked the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] back, sent [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tumbling through the air, engulfed in flame, half [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body simply annihilated – and the Green-Flamed Sword was nowhere to be found."
 caergaraen.2.a: "From Nalne Prih, Munazhlan shakes his head in disappointment."

 caergaraen.3.t: "Mother and Daughter"
 caergaraen.3.d: "Narha downed the rest of the Pheni bottle, then threw it off the side of the ship. The sacred isle of Assakadail – a low mountain rising from waters of the Taras’su Ervan – loomed in the distance. “Ceremony, ritual, history – I should be out there… fighting! Raiding– liberating! Isn’t that what this damned sword wants from me?!”\n\n“Mother.” A disappointed voice to her right – Narha gave a glance to her daughter Kelhana, scoffed as she turned back, even as a purr from her jaguar, lounging on the deck nearby, betrayed her feelings. “This is not just ceremony – this is governance! You are not a pirate any more, you’re a queen! And the threats we face–”\n\nThe Waterclaw laughed suddenly. “They’ll be vanquished by blood and battle!” She drew Saerasyar from its quenching-sheath – let the flickers of green near her face. “Larankar, Ameion, the Bloodcloaks– we don’t beat them sitting on our arses, hiding in our coves. We go out, and we win!”\nKelhana crossed her arms, gave a pout. “We win? That’s it? Why haven’t we ‘just won’ before?”\n\nNarha looked over the blade, the flame-wreathed silver-steel cutting across her daughter. “Because the old kings were weak? Ineffectual? Immoral fools, who rested on their ‘freedom’ while Gophira burned, and Taychend opened itself up to us?”\n\n“Because we do not think! We charge ahead, unmoored, then isolated, then annihilated. Did Munazhlan believe his paradise would come about in a day? Please mother, think of what happened to Saerraeg– to Geladhlan the Liberator, who once wielded the sword in your hands! He burned bright, yes – and then he burnt out. Slain, and his empire with it. Is that what you want?”"
 caergaraen.3.a: "“No… I suppose not. We should keep a measured pace…”"
 caergaraen.3.b: "“No… but I won’t end up like him. To fight is my duty. I won’t shirk it.”"

 caergaraen.4.t: "Fall of Rakkabuttai"
 caergaraen.4.d: "“And Munazhlan said: beware, mine children, the darkness that clouds thy heart, that binds thy soul to Nalne Maedzae. Cast off these chains with might and magic, and with faith and fury concoct the vital potion of your freedom from the blood of those who hath so denied you, and whom hath tempted thee to deny thyself" – Kaemzhlaemat Munazhlan, the Pillars of Munakles \n\nRakkabuttai burned.\n\nThe Chendhyans had stormed the city at dawn, breaking down wall and gate with shaman-force, then pouncing on the Bloodcloak defenders. The fighting had been difficult, bloody, fierce, as jaguar-maws and salvaged Kheionai swords met great-sabre, met plate-and-mail. But the memories of centuries of ceaseless raids, of brutal reprisals, of slavery and subjugation, carried the children of Caergaraen to victory.\n\nAnd Caergaraen’s retribution was swift and merciless. No elf under arms was spared. [Root.Heir.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] was isolated from it, mostly – [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] fought hard to storm the great stepped-temple to Olhokar near the centre of the city. But when [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] did, [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] could see the carnage, the imminent slaughter, from its peak. Grim-faced, [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] raced to the green-flamed beacon slashing near Rakkabuttai’s citadel.\n\n[Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] came to [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] parent as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] stood over the corpse of the Bloodcloak King – [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] jaguar roared as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] saw that King’s wife and young son held besides, waiting to be judged. “No, wait! We fight for our liberty, for retribution, not for wanton slaughter! Send the women and children west, exile them from the steppe, but no more! You hold the sword of Munazhlan in your hands! Do not sully it with a crime like this!”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] looked to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] child, glanced at the burning blade for a moment, then turned back to the captive Taychendi."
 caergaraen.4.a: "“We do not punish evil through evil…. only those with a sword shall die by it.”"
 caergaraen.4.b: "“To the slave, what is the difference between a slaver, and those who tend him?”"

 caergaraen.5.t: "Fate of Oremvand"
 caergaraen.5.d: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] paced around the dock, as the guarded crowd of Chendhyans listened to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] speech. “And when your ancestors made a deal with the Taychendi, they did not merely sign their lands away, but their souls! The Oremvandians were better to us than most – but the rotten Uyr their influence engendered in you was a price that should not have been paid!”\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] drew Saerasyar, gestured to a different group of Chendhyans – beheaded with Saerasyar’s blade, then ignominiously kicked, slowly, one-by-one, into the unending southern sea. They had slave-traders, even if they – and the city they served – had never traded in Chendhyans. Were it up to some of the Caergarae, the entire city would be a burning ruin – but [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew that unlike Rakkabuttai, Oremvand needed a softer touch.\n\n“But Chendhyans– there is another way!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] pointed the Green-Flamed Sword to waiting ships in Oremvand’s Whiteharbour. “A way to redeem what you have done in service to Oremvand! For centuries, the pirates of Caergarae have raided the slave-ships of the Taras’su Ervan, preyed on the vicious slavers of Clemetar and Empkeios – and for centuries, hundreds of ships cross the unending waters of the south, ferrying subjugated peoples, Chendhyans and others, from the warlords of the east to the cities of the west!”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] saw the looks of realization – dread fear – among the Chendhyans in the crowd. To be truthful, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was a little scared herself. But everyone is afraid the first time they leave the surety of land: and the ocean waves were nothing compared to the fury of a cornered Bloodcloak. “Chendhyans of Oremvand– the sea awaits! Ride with me, and let us liberate it!”"
 caergaraen.5.a: "We will be the menace of the southern seas!"

 caergaraen.6.t: "A Call Together"
 caergaraen.6.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] lounged against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] jaguar’s curled form, legs crossed and a sheathed Saerasyar lain across [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] lap. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] felt the gentle purr of the sleeping predator ripple through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] back, smiled as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] grazed a hand over its pitch-black fur.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] didn’t have to be very invested in the meeting going on in the Askalyn at Assakadail, where Munazhlan once sheltered his people. The As-Sadaun, the great recordkeeper, was the real centrepiece here – he was giving a passionate speech on unity, on the threats that face them, on the unfortunate missteps of those who came before. His words were [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ideals – and everyone knew what must be done, what needed to happen.\n\nAt least, that was what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] hoped. One of the Adezhegs stepped forwards, interrupted the As-Sadaun’s speech. “You speak of unity – I ask, why under Caergaraen? Ruffians, bloodthirsty pirates and rabble-rousers, no better than Geladhlan, who caused naught but division, or the fools that incited the Gophiran to attack us not two centuries ago! Who here believes that this,” he said, gesturing to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], “will be any different?”\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Caergaraen smiled. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] jaguar awoke, suddenly but silently – when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] rose, grabbing Saerasyar by the sheath, so did [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mount, stalking towards the dissident chief as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] advanced on him. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] raised Munazhlan’s blade in front of his face. “Do you know what this is?” The dissident gave a quizzical look. “It… is the sword of Munazhlan.” “What do you think it does?” “It protects the Chendhyan people… our liberty.” “And how do you think it does that?” The dissident hesitated again. “It…well– it–”\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] ripped the sheath from Saerasyar’s blade. The blade’s leaping flame flared in the chief’s face.\n\nThe dissident screamed, recoiled from the heat, as [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s jaguar roared, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] raised the blade of Munazhlan high, for all to see. “You ask, ‘why Caergaraen?’ Here’s your answer: when I say I’m going to war, I mean it! The Green-Flamed Sword will never lay idle again!”"
 caergaraen.6.a: "“And if you are so glad to face it, be my guest!”"

 caergaraen.7.t: "Answer The Call"
 caergaraen.7.d: "It has been a while since Caergaraen has started to rekindle the relationships between our people and theirs, and it becomes apparent why: unification. They seek our people and our fighters for one cause: to take Taychend. Do we answer this call? Or spit on such naive brazenness?"
 caergaraen.7.a: "We Answer The Call"
 caergaraen.7.b: "We Refuse The Call"

 caergaraen.8.t: "[From.GetName] Answers the Call!"
 caergaraen.8.d: "Their tribe has accepted our call, and after a roaring speech by our ruler have accepted our request for union. "
 caergaraen.8.a: "They have chosen wisely."

 caergaraen.9.t: "[From.GetName] Refuses The Call!"
 caergaraen.9.d: "[From.GetName] has refused our righteous calling! They declare us naive in the face of such odds, and that they are better off without us!"
 caergaraen.9.a: "We’ll show them!"
