 monstrous.101.d:0 "Our monstrous nature has allowed our people to be ferocious and savage in combat. For aeons our dominions have been a monstrous frontier, unwelcome to most and dangerous to all. We do not subscribe to the civilities of warfare. Our people have fought for their land. Our people have fought to win. Our people have fought to survive.\n\nBut the reformists in our ranks say that we must hold ourselves to a standard greater than our own, that we must fight on the same playing field as our more civilized neighbours.

 #Lizardfolk Events
 monstrous.201.t:0 "The Light of Taneyas"
 monstrous.201.d:0 "In our efforts to spread the truth and beauty of lizardfolk history to foreigners, we face a significant problem in the form of Zytazashtu, ‘nine-colour’, our traditional writing system. Zytazashtu utilises multicoloured inks as a means of expression, but most other species are mildly to severely colour blind, with only a crude ability to recognise yellow and a complete inability to see nitukh, arut or even dark red.\n\nThe use of ink colour to inflect meaning is a vital aspect of classical lizardfolk poetry and political treatise, and traditionalists at court argue that using a narrower range of dyes for foreign editions of these works would be tantamount to watering them down. On the other hand, we could hardly expect perfect comprehension from foreigners, even if they could see properly. If we truly wish to be treated with the requisite respect, outsiders must actually be able to read our defining texts."

 monstrous_vibrant_inks:0 "Vibrant Inks"
 
 monstrous.202.t:0 "Comparative Politics"
 monstrous.202.d:0 "The almost incomprehensible span of lizardfolk history has given rise to an equally ancient tradition of political thought and disputation, such that almost no thought has been produced by outsiders which has not at some time also been pondered by the ancient lizardfolk sages. New editions of these political classics would serve to impress upon outsiders the sheer breadth of history we steward.\n\nPublishing comparative works which map foreign political thought onto our own would serve two purposes: better intelligence on our potential adversaries, and a point thoroughly made to any who would dismiss our intellectual heritage."
 monstrous.202.a:0 "Publish and distribute the comparisons."
 monstrous.202.b:0 "Sponsor a new generation of scholars."
 monstrous.202.c:0 "Do we really have to spell it out for them?"

 monstrous.203.t:0 "Recognise Outsider Envoys"
 monstrous.203.d:0 "Foreigners, particularly among the Horasheshi, often claim that we lizardfolk have no understanding of the principle of diplomatic immunity or guest right. This is of course nonsense: such concepts had gained wide currency as early as the Eleventh Empire, long before these outsiders’ ancestors had so much as stopped voiding their bowels on the ground. Envoys from jumped up tribes, however, who falsely represented themselves as sovereign envoys - these were dismissed posthaste as the charlatans they were, and punished thoroughly for their deceit.\n\nOur more liberal-minded courtiers are suggesting that, were we to accept such claims at face value - at least upon initial contact - this might do much to soften our image in the eyes of foreigners. The question is whether we can accept such an affront to the proper concept of sovereignty."
 monstrous.203.a:0 "Fine, they can bring their little letters."

 monstrous_outsider_envoys:0 "Outsider Envoys"
 
 monstrous.204.t:0 "Mutual Deference Amnesty"
 monstrous.204.d:0 "Part of respect for oneself is an insistence on being greeted and received properly by others. This is a principle of lizardfolk political life which we have never compromised for the cheap approval of outsiders, and yet few of them can ever really master the complex systems of bowing, speech modulation, conversational order and meal choice which constitute the etiquette of the high Naga, for example. This is true even if they have strong command of our language, which few outsiders do.\n\nIn addition, foreign visitors often view this enforced deference as implicitly insulting or demeaning. Lessening the rigidity of such demands on foreign diplomats is a high priority among the outward-looking set at court, as repulsive as it might sound."
 monstrous.204.a:0 "They need not bang their heads on the ground."
 monstrous.204.b:0 "We will preserve our self-respect."
 monstrous.204.c:0 "A new inter-species handshake, maybe?"
 
 monstrous.205.t:0 "Reexamine the Histories"
 monstrous.205.d:0 "It is true that there are some historical Empires whose dealings with foreigners were not quite as frosty as ours tend to be now. Yatkara’s Third Emperor List is replete with fascinating details of the 116th Empire’s dealings with a human entity known as the ‘White Soil People’, though beyond the name, records of this no doubt transient polity are somewhat wanting.\n\nIf we truly seek to interact with foreigners more readily, a thorough reorganisation and consultation of our archival materials could offer a wealth of precedent, informing us of the basis on which such dealings were conducted by our ancestors."

 monstrous.205.b:0 "What is right requires not the approval of the dead."
 monstrous.205.c:0 "A waste of time."
 
 monstrous.206.t:0 "Rule One"
 monstrous.206.d:0 "It has come to our attention that some of the terms used among the lizardfolk for halflings and humans are a source of great offence for their envoys. One does not repeat these particular terms in polite company, referring as they do to the odd scent of animal milk hanging about the torso or the disgusting bloodshot lividity of wobbling flesh, but of course when lizardfolk envoys on the job mutter amongst themselves, they use such language.\n\nTruth be told, the whole affair is somewhat embarrassing; we are used to our tongue being poorly understood by outsiders. Will we really change the very language we speak for these upjumped foreigners? Few of our diplomats will relish being scolded like a child by our monitors, after all."
 monstrous.206.a:0 "We can still say the words at home, at least."

 monstrous.207.t:0 "Linguistic Mutation"
 monstrous.207.d:0 "Lizardfolk diversity and variability is unparalleled in the known world. Specific lizardfolk communities, especially if isolated, can show profound adaptive biological changes within the span of only a few generations, or even as a result of deliberately directed breeding efforts. A few lizardfolk clans have developed membranes and nodules in their throats, allowing them to produce the strange lipped sounds used by other sentients which have always been a source of great difficulty for us. The profound biological obstacle we face in acquiring these alien languages has played an undeniable role in our historical isolation, and so these lizards present a great opportunity.\n\nOur diplomatic corps has requested funding for the identification of such clans, and wishes to devote resources to teaching throat-lipped lizards to speak foreign languages in a formal setting. On the basic principle that we should be more knowledgeable of the outsiders than they are of us, the proposal has growing support."
 monstrous.207.a:0 "These throat-lipped lizards are useful, if a little repulsive."

 monstrous.208.t:0 "Equivalent Majesty"
 monstrous.208.d:0 "A radical idea circulating within the diplomatic corps has in recent days erupted into open conflict at court. Our most reformist diplomats argue that the only means by which we will truly build meaningful relationships with foreign courts is if we recognise their governments as at least conditionally sovereign, their rulers implicitly on a par with lizardfolk monarchs.\n\nThis is a profound shift in diplomatic protocol, though it need not have an enormous impact on the functioning of the court. By no means do we intend to invite foreign sovereigns onto our soil, after all. The question is primarily one of principle, but this does not make it easy to resolve; millennia have been lived under such principles."
 monstrous.208.a:0 "Each can be said to rule their own sphere."
 monstrous.208.b:0 "Lizardfolk rule is world-historically exceptional."
 
 monstrous.209.t:0 "The Halfling Exception"
 monstrous.209.d:0 "Perhaps the only foreigners who make regular forays into lizardfolk territory are the Vyzemby, the halflings who frequent our ports and with whom we have long traded and corresponded. As explorers and traders from ever further afield ply the coast, we increasingly rely on our Vyzemby contacts for knowledge. They are our window to the world, and they alone among foreigners have an appreciation for the depth of our history and culture.\n\nIt would be absurd for newly-arrived foreigners to suddenly enjoy privileges akin to those the Vyzemby have earned through our long friendship. We would never insult their dignity this way. As a result, a faction at court wishes to see our bond with the Vyzemby formally recognised, granting them precedence for audiences, the right to select the location of their embassy, and free movement."

 monstrous.210.d:0 "We have never recognised the capacity of other species to produce high civilisation. They may serve as vassals or even make firm allies, but countless millennia of statecraft and ambition cannot be matched by upstart tribesmen or primitive nepotistic clan structures, no matter how great their skill or how wise their counsel. As we have begun to open to the world, however, we have begun to conceive of a universal principle of sentience, a broad threshold of moral reasoning which all sentient species can be said to have achieved. After all, even humans are not quite as dense as tchoken.\n\nBy virtue of our most ancient tradition, we have come to be more refined than others… but this is a function of time, not morality. We are unique among sentients, but all sentients are capable of steadily working towards high civilisation some time in the future. Promulgating this new understanding will do much to reconcile our institutions to the opening of our society."

 monstrous.211.d:0 "The memory of Karassk runs deep among the humans of Sarhal, to the point that in some rural dialects, Karassk is used as a catch-all term for lizardfolk civilisation. The humans view the dominion of Karassk as a dark stain on their history, a period of repression and misery at the point of our swords, their hopes and dreams ground into the dirt. It’s all terribly dramatic, and they will not stop going on about it.\n\nA gesture of apology for the acts of Karassk, however detached from our current government and way of life, might go a long way to thaw our frigid relationship with humanity. But it is a lowering of ourselves, however one spins it."

 monstrous.215.d:0 "A stateswoman does not concern herself with the clearing of leaves from the bendbark gutters; we have never particularly concerned ourselves with the disapproval of fools and foreigners. Faced with by far the most venerable civilisation in the world, the various human savages who flank Taneyas fester in their impotent jealousy, declaring us monsters. We gather that the flayed humans who of late wander south to Vyzemby are even more ignorant and blinkered in this regard.\n\nSuch a status quo raises problems both pragmatic and prideful. This negative perception marginalises our envoys and merchants, hindering our efforts abroad, and that is bad enough. More fundamentally, we cannot brook the indignity of their continued ignorance. A hundred golden ages had passed for us before these people had so much as learned to fix flint to a meagre bit of wood. It is high time they understood this."

Though the niceties are still awkward, we now receive envoys more or less smoothly, and can compel them through politeness to show dignified deference to our leaders. This is the lesson of the lizardfolk: adapt if you must, but maintain your dignity. Never allow the world to see you needily scrape, or they will replace ‘monster’ with ‘beggar’ and continue quite merrily with their disrespect.\n\nWe are the standard bearers for the oldest civilisation on Halann, and this legacy now garners the respect it should. Never will we sacrifice the principles which make us great."

 monstrous.300.t:0 "A Terrible Misunderstanding"
 monstrous.300.d:0 "Many of our neighbors have never seen a harpy outside of periodic raids on their settlements, and know very little of us outside of our fearsome reputation. Perhaps this is why we have received the news from the border that we have. \n\nA harpy was flying on her way back to her nest with her loving husband in her arms when she was accosted by an angry mob seeking to “save” the man from his spouse. They shot her down, and though her spouse managed to save himself from a severe fall, the harpy herself is in critical condition and her survival is far from certain. The man has come to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in a bitter rage to see if anything might be done as retribution against the attackers."

This would impose a great hardship upon our treasury in the short term, but the merchants are hungry for new markets and would likely be incentivized to stick around and incorporate us on their trade routes if we promise them safety from our raiding parties."

 monstrous.303.d:0 "The songs of our ancestors’ hunts have been handed down to us in an unbroken chain by generation upon generation of harpy chroniclers, whose labor has ensured that they have persevered on in a largely unchanged form since their occurrence. We sing the songs of our ancestors to ensure that the generations after us learn what it is to hunt, so that the hunts of the future might be as glorious as the hunts of the past. \n\nHowever, our hunts have changed in recent years. As we attempt to gain better relations with our neighbors, some among the flock have raised the point that many of these tales are rather grisly and violent, and that if the purpose of the old tales is to shape new hunts, perhaps we would be better off making some light changes to their characters’ motivations and actions. \n\nThis is not a step to be taken lightly, but if we decide to move forward with it we could set the stage for more peaceful relations with our neighbors permanently."

 monstrous.304.d:0 "In our efforts to make ourselves presentable to our surrounding nations, we have run into a persistent roadblock- their diplomats seem to be uneasy around our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Our rule over the Bulwari has never been effortless, of course, but we will never be seen as anything more than monsters if we cannot convince the dignitaries, traders, and rulers of the humans that they can feel at ease in our lands. \n\nOur experts on human culture report that some of this disconnect might be due to the rarity of matriarchal societies in the human world. When this is combined with the imposing figure the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] projects, this could be the source of the tension on the part of the largely male diplomats. \n\nIt might be easier for the diplomats to understand our governing structure if we were to create the impression for them that the men, especially the spouses of figures of note, have more power and influence within our country than is actually the case. A number of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s own harem have already volunteered to assist, and it likely would not be any hardship to them to march around as dignitaries for a while."

 monstrous.305.t:0 "The Land of Opportunity"
 monstrous.305.d:0 "Since the first days of harpy rule, the human villages under our protection have had two means of paying tribute- in gold or in men. This system is hated by the poorer villages that could not afford to pay in any means other than their population, and now that we are making attempts at reform we have commenced an overhaul of the system in order to better align it with human sensibilities. Although the new system of tribute is graduated based on village prosperity, it favors compensation in gold rather than mates to make up for the resulting treasury shortfall, and it is already apparent that the demonsterization of our tribute system will result in some rather dire demographic trends. \n\nIn a series of emergency meetings, our advisors have come up with a plan to address this problem. The advisors tell us that with some efforts to spread the word, bribes to immigrants, and some judicious usage of enchantment magic, we might be able to entice enough of the men of surrounding nations to come to [Root.GetName] to return our demographics to acceptable levels. Although expensive and somewhat radical, this is the best idea our greatest minds have been able to come up with that doesn’t involve a wholesale return to the old system. What shall we do?"
 monstrous.305.a:0 "What an amazing idea!"

 monstrous.307.t:0 "The Color of Valor"
 monstrous.307.d:0 "If the flock is the brain of harpy society, its soul is the warband- flocks of soldiers which not only organize our young warriors during raids, but provides them a sense of structure and social status. The warbands each have different rituals, symbols, and colors to distinguish themselves during the raids, and even out of battle harpies who share a warband regard each other as something close to kin. \n\nUnfortunately, the shrieking songs and dashing colors of our storied warbands have grown to be hated and feared by our human neighbors as a natural consequence of their success in battle. Harpies will often display their warband markings as symbols of pride even in their civilian roles, but a human who sees a harpy with warband markings as a trader, diplomat, or a dignitary will often refuse to deal with her all together out of anger at what is perceived as chauvinism or a kind of violent savagery. Professionalization or reform of the warbands may appease our neighbors enough to fix some of these issues, but at what cost?"
 monstrous.307.a:0 "The warbands will have to abandon their markings for the sake of better relations."

The first reports back seemed to indicate things were going well, but the most recent dispatch we have received was rather strange. \n\nThere has been a change in command in the detachment our allies sent to train with us, and it seems the new commander knows very little of our race. He has informed our unit leader that he cannot, in good conscience, do anything that might contribute to women being put in danger in combat, and therefore has requested that we replace the detachment we sent for training with an all-male one. He has refused all attempts by our people on the ground to explain to him why exactly that is impossible. It seems the situation must be escalated further up the chain of command."

Some are the anguished cries of the women and the children, who knew all along that it was not safe here yet never thought the danger would come for them. But what is the danger? What are the loudest screams, those keening martial sounds above the air? \n\nThey are ours, of course. But unlike the fleshy groundbound blobs from whom we take our due, we do not scream out of anger or impotence. As our warriors dance among the sky they cannot help but shriek their cries of joy, for we are of the hills and the hills belong to us, and there can be no greater glory than that."

It would seem like a small thing to adopt the customs of our neighbors, but our talons are unwieldy when not perched or nestled somewhere comfortable, and as we move our torsos forward our wings seem to ripple uncomfortably. Every time we do so, we long to take flight and pay tribute in a way more befitting our kind, but a harpy flying in a human court still causes terror beyond our intentions. \n\nThere have been benefits to our integration, of course. Some of the neighbors have been receptive to our overtures, and in turn have sent diplomats who, when not quaking in fear, try and fail to hold themselves with the bearing of a harpy. From these representatives we have learned to speak the language of migration treaties and foreign relations, but there is much to learn and many adjustments to be made before that potential can be realized."

Perhaps this is why the songs began- so we could ensure our future without losing ourselves. \n\nOf course, the world outside is not so bad, and if there was not room for it in our tales before, it was by conscious choice. As our land is enriched by links of commerce and foreign connections that would have seemed impossible a short time ago, [Root.GetName] stands on the brink of a new age, where as we sing our neighbors harmonize."
