While we may have many differences, we share a desire to form a strong and unified realm for all orcs to call home.

Among the tribesmen of our clan a new faith is spreading like wildfire.\nSurakel, God of the Bulwari, has summoned us to this land. Our arrival was not a random happenstance, but predestined. We are His chosen, destined to free the Humans from the lies of the elves and the chains of the gnolls.\nWe have chosen to embrace this idea, and now seek to fulfill Surakel's will and free His people.\nTo do so, the newly formed orc priesthood of Surakel has demanded the founding of Karashar, the City of the Black Sun, from where we will be able to rule all of Bulwar in the name of Surakel."

The purpose could not quite be made out, but the repeated promises of safety ameliorated the priesthood's worries. And so a handful of junior priests departed, riding some of the Kingdom's least-valuable horses.\n\nAs the emissaries approached, at roughly Noon, they saw a field of silver and black waiting outside [Root.Capital.GetName] — thousands upon thousands of Black Orcs, armor-clad, arrayed around a small hill. The priests looked askance at one another, but none wanted to be the first to suggest cowardice, and so they slowly nudged their steeds towards this convocation.\n\nThe envoys neared, having to force their mounts along — especially when the orcs started to beat their weapons against one another, and parted ranks to let them through. Each polished blade flickered, illuminated in the high Noon sun. Swallowing their fear and their bewilderment, the delegation continued through the throng, towards the figure at its center.\n\nThat figure: a tall orc, skin as black as night, a sharp contrast to the golden crown gleaming in his hands. He gestures the delegation to stop, and its leader dismounts. The orc briefly closes his eyes, nods. He steps forward, places the crown in the Dartaxi priest's hands, and kneels before him. The noise all around suddenly ceases, the land goes quiet, all Bulwar seeming to hold its breath.\n\nThat priest has been in his position only a few years, in the priesthood less than a decade. What could he say? What could he do, aside from the obvious? And so with trembling hands he places the crown on the chieftain's head. A moment passes, two. And then the orc rises, the silence is broken. Every orc chants a single word: "Karakal! Karakal! Karakal!""

Why have we remained in this wretched land?\nOnly those who take risks make it big, and only those who take the greatest of risks can earn Ara's blessing.\nWe remained, we built, we forged our house into a new realm.\nIn the name of Ara, our gamble will pay off one day.\nOne just has to trust her plan."

Homes burned to the ground, fields painted red and steel meeting steel at every corner.\nIt was chaos.\nWe fought alongside Corin and through her sacrifice we managed to stop the carnage.\nYet after all our struggles we were left in a land in ruins. Amongst us both children of the Lion and the Silver Dragon claimed a shared piece of the ashes.\nMany attempted to rebuild Escann, to claim the legacy of the chivalric realms for their own, to return to a past that was irredeemably lost.\nWe reject that notion, clinging to the old ways can only result in the final downfall of Escann. No, we see the need to create something new, something better.\nA nation not just for the Busilari, or just the Marchers. Not just for humans nor the orcish invaders or anyone else.\nNo.\nWe shall build a home for us all, a bridge we all can walk towards the future - Stalbór."

Cast out for what she believed was right, she fell into disgrace, her name was besmirched, and those who followed her were scattered to the winds.\n\nShe wandered to another land and fought beside its defenders against the creatures that came to destroy it. In the aftermath of this supposed victory, she found her companion dead, the garden she tried to protect reduced to embers and the monsters still roaming.\n\nSo she fought on.\n\nIn the ruins of Escann, she gathered what remained. From the ashes, she began to shape something new. And with the blood of the beasts nourishing her roots, she set out to grow a garden of her own."

The greatest of us all forged his legacy by erecting the wonders that made the Empire of the Silver Dragon shine brighter than the sun.\nBalgar, our great forefather, made this land his home once.\nLike him, we shall do so again.\nBrick by brick, Escann will rise to meet the skies.
