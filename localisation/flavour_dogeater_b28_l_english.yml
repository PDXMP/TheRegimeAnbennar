 flavour_dogeater.0.d:0 "\"Hold it right there, whelp. One step further and you’ll be out of our clan’s protection and into Dogeater’s hunting grounds.\nHm? Never heard of them before? Not from around here, are ya?\n\nSimply put, the Dogeater clan cares not for honor. Nothing is too low for them; they eat dogs for Dookan’s sake. Every night I hear their screams and shouts as they endlessly brawl each other over the most minor squabbles. Not sure if they’re hollerin’ with glee or agony anymore, hell, it might be both for all I know! They claim to be a clan of the strong, yet all I see is disgraceful savagery. Step into their territory by just a margin, and droves of warg riders will ambush you and corner you into a fight. It’s how I lost my eye here, see? Barely escaped with the rest of my limbs intact.\n\nI must admit, a true orc cannot help but admire their brazen strength and questionable bravery. In fact, I have heard their chieftain dwarfs even the largest of our clan - rumors say he may have ogre blood in his veins. Many of his clan would even happily boast that his father killed Corin, that he was stronger than Korgus. Simple ravings of idiotic lunatics, I would say. If he was truly that strong, where was he in Castanoth? Where was he when Corin actually killed Korgus? Too busy fighting against his own men, apparently…\n\nBut still, I cannot emphasize this enough: You are wargfeed if you choose to step any closer to those brutes.\""

Yet not many can compare to those of Dogeater. They fight with almost gleeful rage, eat anything they can get their hands on, not only slaying their fellow orcs at a moment's notice but also ready to backstab their commanders without a second thought.\n\nAs towns and villages get razed to the ground, more and more, including me, have fled to the concealed hill forts. Things seem dire, but I remain steadfast in hope. Our clan has gone through worse times, worse tragedies and it won't simply end to these metalheads!

Many of us managed to flee to the woods and set up resistance efforts, inspired by his final speech. However, our efforts have not borne fruit. Many of us died in the last gambit to reclaim our clan, and I’m starting to lose hope myself. In fact, ever since then, the Dogeaters have only become more violent, more savage, more uncaring and more battle-hungry. They cannot be bribed, for they have no need for scraps of gold. They cannot be intimidated, for they are assured they will be reborn even in death. They CANNOT be reasoned with, for they can only respond in shouts and grunts. Though I remain hopeful still, surely a clan constantly on the brink of implosion is not long for this world, right?"

 flavour_dogeater.5.d:0 "There Lothane stood.\n\nA ringing sound infested his ears, his eyes saw only pure white. He thought for a moment he was finally meeting Corin once again. Yet this blinded hope was quickly shattered. First, the ringing faded to a large roar - no, multiple roars from- hundreds of orcs in unison, mixed with screams of pain and terror. After, his sight returned, bearing witness to orcs pouring through the keep’s walls, freshly burnt and broken by a magical explosion. Each partook in the slaughter, no discrimination between soldiers and civilians. To them, there was no distinction between either - except which ones required a harder swing.\n\nYet out of all of the countless orcs that clouded his eye, one stood taller than the rest. An orc of few words, preferring screams and one word commands, charging through his men, slashing with a giant axe and tossing people above the keep’s walls. Still, he did not falter to the beast - he had not survived the Greentide and followed Corin just to end up dead at the hands of a mindless brute. With one final prayer to the gods and to Corin, to give him strength, the grandmaster gripped his blade tight, lunging at the orc. It roared in distress, turning and swinging its axe randomly at Lothane as a sharp pain spread through its abdomen, sluggishly missing him each time the axe cracked the ground. Lothane stabbed it again, enraging it even further. He feinted back, planning to continue dodging the beast until it tired out. Yet suddenly, he felt himself slamming against a wall as he leapt back. Just as quickly as he realized this, he was just as quickly bashed into it, felling him to the ground.\n\nThere Lothane laid\n\nBones cracked, he couldn’t feel his breath any longer, he couldn't move his body. It seemed his prayers were unanswered. He realized there was no Corin, no Nerat to grant him strength now. There was nothing he could do now but perhaps finally meet Corin again.\n\nAnd with his death, the final memory of the true vestige of Corin disappeared from this world."

On top, Dûsh held the last spawn of Korgus’s, Gurzan’s, head with his palm. The young, ambitious, and once upstart orc gazed with a deadpan expression upon his clansmen who were still alive in chains. He felt strange. Not absolute despair, nor unending rage, just plain disappointment - as he was reminded of his father’s words. He prided himself as the last of his siblings to stay standing; it was the only thing he had. But now? It was clear that it was merely dumb luck.\n\nBefore he could finish his thought, he was thrown down the cliff of the mountain, face first into his men in chains. As he fell, thousands of orcs roared upon the mountain, whether it be the terror of the Bloodgorgers or the warcry of the Dogeaters.\n\nAnd with his death, the last living legacy of Korgus Dookanson was slain."

 flavour_dogeater.101.d:0 "Despite the catastrophe that happened around Dûsh’s death, the situation miraculously has gotten better, and somehow I survived through it all. Clouded Eye orcs aren’t targeted on sight anymore - some of the orcs are now even willing to listen to what we have to say! But the need for a new Warchief is still clear. Four candidates have come up on top of the rabble.\n\nThe first is a drinking companion of Dûsh who claims to have bested him in single combat while he was alive, meaning he is therefore the strongest. His claims are entirely baseless, though, on account of the fact witnesses report both were blackout drunk during said combat and no blood was shed.\n\nThe second is a powerful warglord who has earned the respect of the others due to their military skill earning us many victories, having thrown themselves in harm's way to save Dûsh’s life mid-battle. For this, they were allowed to carve an entire lesser clan of their own under the Dogeaters, now using their influence and fame for legitimacy.\n\nThe third is an orc who convinced others to back up their claim entirely due to promises of glory and riches. Whether it be Castanoth, Rottenstep or Dogwood, they’ve been and fought there, allegedly. Though there is actually no concrete proof of their achievements, their alluring words alone managed to auspiciously captivate the most cynical orcs into admiration.\n\nThe last, and very much the least, is a faraway vagabond who has no record of warfare, who claims to have travelled farther than any orc has in search of wisdom, learnt how to read most human languages during his free time, and promises to teach others the same things he learnt on his journey. I am surprised at how an orc of such high intellect can come from this clan.\n\n\nImpressively enough, all four of them have enough support amongst the clan and respect each other enough to not cause any excessive bloodshed should they fail to become Warchief. The honor will fall upon the winner of a free for all, which will unfortunately not be to the death due to the need for leadership at this dire moment.”"

 B28_warg_breeding_desc:0 "\"While a few beast tamers have acquired such beasts to the impressment of their party, large-scale warg taming would only be achieved in recent histories in the Far East by hobgoblins and in Cannor by orcs. The methods of which this was achieved was drastically different. The Command sought to break down and subjugate these beasts like their many conquests, turning them obedient. In a similar yet different manner, many of the Greentide clans sought control of wargs early in their conquests through violent subjugation.Most notable among them were the Beasteater and Dogeater clans, the latter of which saw the ferocious rebelliousness of wargs entertaining and worthy of challenge and brought it to the battlefield with them. Perhaps it is because of this that Dogeater would define cavalry tactics of Escanni Orcs for generations to come that emphasized the raw, untamed strengths of wargs over horses. This is evidenced by the sheer size of their warg breeds that emerged. Dogeater orcs could sometimes be seen riding wargs nearing the size of a small mammoth, charging straight into their enemies with heavy waraxes and a simple pistol as a sidearm…\"\n\n- Wargs and War"

This was mostly seen in what would become the Warglords, minor orcish clan leaders constantly seeking war, loot and plunder. While nominally subservient to Dogeater, these clans were almost entirely independent to act at their own freewill, only giving in to demands through respect or proving duels. Later on, even though Dogeater agreed to federate with Clouded Eye in the name of orcish unity, many Warglords did not see it this way, feeling disdain for Unguldavor’s way of life and seeming abandonment of valor. The Ozdan would continue on to act as an almost independent political force within Unguldavor, becoming at times a powerful seasoned military force while remaining unstoppable looters and pillagers even with their own kind.../"\n\n-Legacy of the Greentide"

 B28_all_parties_must_end_desc:0 "\"Dûsh wus quite a strong orc. Wa had a good time under ‘im, pillagin’ and hearing screams of weakling never got old. However, da time after hiz death nearly tore us ladz apart, killing our own boyz just ta settle a dispute over who should lead da wuns who haven’t died fightin’ against dem. Dis is no way ta live, continuing as such will inevitably lead to our doom. Timez are changing, just like the clan. Many of our orcs ‘ave stopped moving around az much, digged up ashed farmland an’ no longer dismantling dere portable homes. Dey say iz eazier, stabler dis way. Perhaps it iz betta dis way, humanz may be weak but ya ain’t eva gonna deny how good dere food and grog iz.’Course, we shall not stop fightin’ and ridin’, dere iz still a whole world who hate uz out dere. But Iz time ta stop moving on, iz time ta settle down.\""
