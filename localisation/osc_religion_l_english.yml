 ###Aspects

  aga_cult_aspect_1:0 "Cult of Aga"
  desc_aga_cult_aspect_1:0 "The Cult of Aga differs from other sects of the sun cult in that they are focused on their veneration of King Aga of Karqašlu and his empire, seen as the one true state chosen by Surakel. While the followers of the Cult of Aga recognize Jaher as Surakel Reborn and that Surakel chose the Sun Elves to continue with Jaher’s duty, they consider themselves as the heirs of the First Surakel Reborn. This veneration is much more profound than merely a reverence of his bloodline, because for the Cult of Aga, he was the first to prove that anyone can become Chosen through martial and conquest prowess, just as Dimuzi once did."

They believe in the supremacy of the Bulwari people over all others and that magic should be returned to its legitimate owners. Banished and persecuted from most realms within Bulwar, rumours say they still gather, seeking to free Hašahu, their immortal founder, whom they consider the rightful ruler of all of Bulwar, destined to usher in a new golden age."

  purity_cult_aspect_1:0 "Cult of Purity"
  desc_purity_cult_aspect_1:0 "The Cult of Purity believes Chaos and Darkness have already come to Bulwar. For them, the Garden of Surakel is broken and corrupted, but they still believe that healing the people and the land is possible. They see that all races have a part to play in Bulwar; no one group is superior to the others. The elves and dwarves, just as humans and the so-called monstrous races of harpies and gnolls, all have a higher calling to serve Surakel. Religious rituals, magic rituals, and even lying or deceiving - any method is valid if it brings peace and avoids further corruption.\n\nWithin the Cult, some take the 'any method is valid' approach more seriously than most; those are the Šebhuliam, who say extreme solutions are needed to redeem a place so obviously broken and corrupted."

  desc_citadel_cult_aspect_1:0 "The Cult of the Five Thousand is found in Bahar and believes in the notion of sacrifice and unity as paramount virtues required to stand against the enemies of Bulwar. They take inspiration from the legendary last stand of the five thousand Bahari, Suncrown, Castanorian, and Damerian soldiers against the Serpent-king, 1500 years ago. They do not believe that chosenhood is possible to attain for mere mortals, preferring to revere the virtues of soldiers, from any place or race, who stood for what is right and protected the innocent."

  wisemaster_cult_aspect_1:0 "Cult of the Aphorisms"
  desc_wisemaster_cult_aspect_1:0 "Practiced mainly by the Gelkar in the Harpy Hills, where life is simpler, the doctrine of the Cult of Aphorism can be summed up by one motto: study the past to understand the present. They dedicate their time to study the classic scriptures of the Dinu Sar, the canon of the Sun Cult, taking lessons filled with wisdom from it, and condensing these insights into poignant aphorisms. For them, Chosenhood is defined by dedication to scriptural studies and wisdom, not violence or piety. Aphorists exist in between the Old and New Sun Cults, as their craft is appreciated by all the Gelkar, despite their unorthodox views on Chosenhood."

  desc_law_cult_aspect_1:0 "Few know about the Cult of the Eclipse, which is half myth and half nightmare to other followers of Surakel and temporal authorities. Their meetings and congregations are kept secret and hidden away from eyes deemed unworthy. They believe that the Onslaught which devastated Bulwar in antiquity and the rise of monstrous races in its aftermath were a salvation disguised as a punishment from Surakel, meant to purge those sinners who were corrupted by the Malevolent Dark. This notion is a truly heterodox theological interpretation which has led many outsiders over the centuries to consider this cult as almost heretical."

These gnolls stand firm and proud in their faith in Surakel, their towns and cities covered with depictions of the iconic Red Flame. They believe that when Surael burned the Salahad, sparing them was a sign that they had been given the sacred duty of fighting their corrupted siblings and the fallen Goddess who created them.

Their spiritual leaders are the szal-Maqet, the descendants of Maqet, who liberated their ancestors from the gnolls of Bulwar and guided them to these lands.
