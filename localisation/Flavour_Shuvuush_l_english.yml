 shuvuush_to_ward_title:0 "To Ward..."
 shuvuush_to_ward_desc:0 ""Why do we wear the masks, aba?"\n"To keep the Facestealers away, darling."\n"Why do we keep the Facestealers away, aba?"\n"Because they take our faces, feather."\n"Why do they take our faces, aba?"\n"Hmm… I suppose they must be hungry, sweet."\n"Why are they hungry, aba?"\n"Oh… I don't know!"\n"Do I have to wear the mask?"\n"Yes dear, you have to wear the mask."\n\nSince the days of the Huususing, our people have been in a constant struggle against the scourge-upon-humanity, the blight of Gozengun, the so-called Facestealers. Lifeless husks that prey upon every living being and any spirit they come across, the source of their hunger - if one can call their unquenchable thirst for erasing spirit and life as such - is unknown even to the most senior of Death Priests. The Three Brothers gave our people the means to ward off the threat, for the Shepherd of Souls himself gave the knowledge of mask-making to Tsagaan. Even if the threat of encountering a facestealer in the south is relatively low, no Shuvüüsh leaves the family tent with their face exposed. Ever."
 shuvuush_to_ward_effect_tt:0 "Select one of the following personalities to give to both your §Y[Root.Monarch.GetTitle]§! and §Y[Root.Heir.GetTitle]§!: §YConqueror§!, §YKind-Hearted§!, §YLawgiver§!, §YBold Fighter§!, §YInspiring Leader§!, or §YMartial Educator§!"

 shuvuush_to_forget_title:0 "To Forget."
 shuvuush_to_forget_desc:0 ""When is iji coming back, aba?"\n"Your mother's not coming back, dear."\n"Why not? Did I do something bad?"\n"...No, sweet-thing. You've done nothing bad. But it would be best if you forget your iji."\n"Forget… Forget iji? Aba! No! I don't wanna! I'm not gonna!"\n"Shh… shh… it's alright. Do you remember when Moon-face got that nasty gash on her claw last summer, and we had to eat her?"\n"Y…yeah? Are we gonna eat iji?"\n"No! But… sometimes, life is hard, and it hurts some people more than others. Your mother was hurt a lot."\n"..."\n"...Can I at least see iji before we leave?"\n"It would be better not to. Here… I'll take you to the Mask-Temple soon. It will help the soul."\n\nFacestealers are named as such for the main tactic they employ when approaching humans and other sentient beings; shapeshifting into the faces of victims past. The mechanisms of this are not exactly known, but it is known that these psychic parasites thrive on the remembrance of their presumed identity. Their “own” remembrance of who they once were, as well as everyone else’s. As time passes and the person that used to be is forgotten by all, including the spiritual parasitic husk that has usurped his identity itself, the Facestealer shall be no more. So it is law among the Shuvüüsh to forget those who are known to have fallen victims to Gozengun’s blight. Name children after them so you think of them when you utter a name. Leave their faceless bodies unburied to be consumed by the permafrost. And when you see them, remind yourself that you DO. NOT. REMEMBER."
 shuvuush_to_forget_trigger_tt:0 "Have defeated at least §Y1§! Facestealer Horde."
 shuvuush_to_forget_trigger_2_tt:0 "Owns §Y[5415.GetName]§! while §YNurgai§! has passed."
 shuvuush_to_forget_effect_tt:0 "All owned §YMask Homes§! gain §G+1§! Base Tax and §G+1§! Base Manpower\n\nThe §YMask Home§! we own with the highest development begins construction of a §YChurch§! for §Y50%§! of the time and §Y0%§! of the cost."

 shuvuush_to_fight_title:0 "To Fight!"
 shuvuush_to_fight_desc:0 "Warding the threat is one thing. Fending it off is a whole other business. There are few ways to successfully fight a facestealer. The Spiritfire of the Ashwoven Harimari, the supreme exorcists of Gowon and the High Monks of the Rukunai all claim to be able to wound facestealers to various degrees. Powerful spirits can also theoretically fight them. The Shuvüüsh have three proven ways to fight the Facestealers. First and foremost, the Black Shamans, who can conduct Spiritual warfare to an unparalleled degree, to the point all but the most powerful of spirits steer clear of them. Second, the Onyx Blades, which can outright properly wound facestealers. Both the Black Masks and the Onyx Blades are limited in supply, spread across the steppe and beyond. So comes the third way, the burning incense of jasmine and juniper. Facestealers freeze when confronted with this incense, while direct contact with it forces them to retreat. So, the Shuvüüsh rely on a rather unorthodox tactic to push the facestealers back. Upon their steeds, they form units led by White Shamans, who spread incense across the battlefield, briefly stunning the facestealers. This short window allows the riders to wound the creatures’ corporeal form, forcing the lifeless husks to flee back to their strongholds."
 shuvuush_to_fight_trigger_tt:0 "We have driven back the §YHost of Facestealers§!... for now."
 shuvuush_to_fight_trigger_2_tt:0 "We have switched §YMasks§! at least §Y3§! times."
 shuvuush_to_fight_effect_tt:0 "The §Y[Root.Monarch.GetTitle]§! will gain §G+1§! Administrative Skill and §G+1§! Military Skill. If we are plagued by a §YFacestealer Infestation§!, one of the provinces will §Gdecrease§! in size. Otherwise, gain §G+25§! Prestige"

 shuvuush_surrounded_cornered_title:0 "Surrounded, Not Cornered"
 shuvuush_surrounded_cornered_desc:0 "The steppe has been in turmoil for far too long. Following the dissolution of Bhengudak’s empire, the terror-bird riders have been subject to constant infighting, unable to effectively strike against their pretentious neighbours. The unprecedented unity amongst the Khudi to the north and the consolidation of Gowon under successive Spirit-Kings have left the Shuvüüsh struggling for spoils gathered by short, disparate raiding parties. Combined with the everlooming threat of the Facestealers in the west, the nomads find themselves surrounded. However, the winds of change are blowing. The neighbouring empires are on the verge of collapse and civil strife, while the waters in Yanshen are being tested more and more by the southern nomads. It is time to remind our neighbours the meaning of terror."
 shuvuush_surrounded_cornered_trigger_tt:0 "§YWon a war§! against a nation in the §YYanshen§! subcontinent"
 shuvuush_surrounded_cornered_effect_req_tt:0 "Completed one of the mission objectives:"

 shuvuush_surrounded_cornered_effect_tt:0 "Gain General with §G90§! tradition and §G+2§! Siege."

 shuvuush_favor_yomod_title:0 "Favor of the Yomod Rüsh"
 shuvuush_favor_yomod_desc:0 "The Yomod Rüsh represent the lower nobility of Shuvüüsh society: families which are tasked with taking care of each tribe’s stock of terror-birds, a burden that some of the most prestigious amongst them can trace as far back as the time of the Three Brothers. Toeing the line between glorified herders and nobility, the Yomod Rüsh take pride in their mastery of the terror-bird. The particularities of the creature’s lifecycle necessitates that these families follow opposite migration patterns to the Clans’ main body. Despite each family being nominally loyal to a particular Bhaatun, the loyalties of the Yomod Rüsh - due to their de facto autonomous status - can be very fickle. We need to make sure that those loyal to us remain so, for the terror-birds are not a luxury for the Shuvüüsh, but an outright necessity for survival."

 shuvuush_return_white_title:0 "Return to White"
 shuvuush_return_white_desc:0 "All life strives to return to White. Almost all, for there is evil in the world, evil that seeks to maintain Black, seeks to prevent us from becoming one with the Supreme Spirit. It is the solemn duty of every Saanorgheh faithful to fight against this evil, with the foremost of it being the facestealers. Our peoples’ recent unification under a single banner, coupled with recent understandings and advancements by our Shamans puts us in an unprecedented position to effectively combat the evil that plagues this world. For we are the Shuvüüsh, and we are the world’s bulwark against evil, even if we get little to no credit for it."
 shuvuush_return_white_effect_tt:0 "Whenever we §YSwap Masks§!, if we swap to a §YWhite Mask§!, gain '§YAncestral Guidance§!' for §Y5§! years, granting Reform Progress Growth §G+10.0%§!. If we swap to the §YBlack Mask§!, instead gain §G+15§! Army Tradition.\n"

 shuvuush_rule_steppe_title:0 "To Rule the Steppe"
 shuvuush_rule_steppe_desc:0 "It has been centuries since the Shuvüüsh rallied under the same banner. Since the crumbling of Guwaamud, the steppe tribes have been at each other’s throats, vying for dominance of the steppe. Rarely, they would come under brief vassalage of one another against common threats, but these agreements would last a few short years at best. The moment there was no external threat, infighting would begin anew and the cycle of constant regional warlordism would seem inescapable. But that is not our people’s fate, and it falls upon our noble clan and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to unite the steppe and usher in a new era for our people."
 shuvuush_rule_steppe_trigger_tt:0 "§YWon a war§! against a nation of the §YSaanorgegh§! faith"
 shuvuush_rule_steppe_effect_req_tt:0 "\nIf this mission is completed before §Y1447§! AA:"

 shuvuush_one_kaasheg_title:0 "Only One Kaasheg"
 shuvuush_one_kaasheg_desc:0 "The Izhuuns are no more. They have all bent the knee to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Be it through might or cunning, peacefully or by force, the tribes of the Shuvüüshudi all pay allegiance to our banners. Their warriors now fill our ranks: old Bhaatuns maintaining their coherence and distinct identities while new ones are organized from the remnants of the more disloyal ones and the survivors of brutal engagements that left tribes unable to function as normal. There is no other force in the steppe, no other polity for our people to be part of. We are the Shuvüüsh and we all follow the first unanimously recognized Kaasheg in centuries."
 shuvuush_one_kaasheg_effect_req_tt:0 "\nIf this mission is completed before §Y1450§! AA:"

 shuvuush_break_realms_title:0 "Break the Stable Realms"
 shuvuush_break_realms_desc:0 "Our neighbours, the so-called “civilized” folk, look down on us from every direction. Their sedentary lifestyles provide them with the luxury of spending time contemplating their supposed superiority. Complacency, however, breeds weakness. We shall exploit this weakness and plunder the riches of these lands for ourselves. Timber and steel from the forests of the Khudi and all sorts of loot from Gowon and Yanshen. The time is nigh to remind all of our neighbours the true terror that stalks the inhospitable steppes."
 shuvuush_break_realms_effect_req_tt:0 "\nIf this mission is completed before §Y1460§! AA:"
 shuvuush_break_realms_effect_tt:0 "When you conquer §Y[4925.GetName]§!, §Y[5353.GetName]§!, and §Y[6811.GetName]§!, generate an advisor that costs §G25%§! as much as normal"

 shuvuush_fate_anew_title:0 "Fate Born Anew"
 shuvuush_fate_anew_desc:0 "Our tribe has achieved what was thought to be impossible in the present day. A unified steppe is one thing, but following in Bhengudak's footsteps and bringing our neighbours to heel is another. It is certain that this is only the first step. Our military tactics have been time and time again proven to be superior to those of our neighbours, and despite being seen as outside conquerors our people seem to handle the administration of these new lands with more ease than expected. No matter the path our people will choose for themselves, from western Kaasheg to the shores of Dangun and to the great city of Tianlou, a new era is beginning for the Shuvüüsh."

 ### Events ###
 shuvuush.0.t:0 "Swapping Your Mask"
 shuvuush.0.d:0 "Which mask you wear is of great importance to the Shuvüüsh, as it signifies several things: first, it determines who you are representing at the moment: whether clan heads choose to wear their clan mask, or their personal one, is often a matter of petty political importance. It signifies whose counsel you are accepting at the moment, as you may speak to the spirit(s) inside the mask (if there are any present).\n\nSome are greatly constant in their choice of mask. Shamans in particular never switch their mask, with black-masked death-priests and white-masked medicine-men making their positions in society clear at all times. For others, they change which mask they wear frequently, displaying with pride the great range of options they have access to. Yet others only wear the clan masks for special occasions, unable to bear the bickering between family spirits. A sign of a functional family can be determined by how frequently its head chooses to represent its members."

 shuvuush.1.t:0 "The Faceless Queen"
 shuvuush.1.d:0 "The Nuugdan Tsarai have long been the most powerful clan of the Shuvüüsh, though it has stood fractured since the Sun Elves reigned over us, their officials fostering rivalries between the minor clans to keep us divided and weak. What was once the terror of Yanshen devolved into warring clans, families, tribes and hordes more of a threat to themselves than anybody else.\n\nRecently we have seen the rise of Kusheng Nurgai of the Bagaatun clan, who aspires to one day become the Izhuun, or perhaps even Kaasheg. Uniting the warring clans under her command, she wears today not the mask of the Bagaatun clan, but her own personal mask: a stark, faceless design, wood stained with bone. She intends on forging her own legacy, her own family, her own empire. Today, she takes the first steps towards achieving that goal."
 shuvuush.1.a:0 "Long reign Nurgai, the Nuugdan Kusheng!"
 nuugdan_raze_hint:0 "Before we begin, we should consider dealing with our new conquests in the south by §Rrazing them to the ground§! and §Ruprooting their expensive forts§!!"

 shuvuush.2.t:0 "More Than A Queen"
 shuvuush.2.d:0 "With the unfortunate passing of the great conqueror Kusheng Nurgai Bagaatun, the Shuvüüsh people have lost one of their finest. As thousands make their way to Zougzengom to visit her grave and pay their respects, the locals begin constructing a temple around it. Whilst the people were in mourning however, the shamans of the Saanorgegh communities were busy asking the spirit world for guidance.\n\nTo their surprise a familiar voice answered. The Faceless Queen is still alive, in the heavens! She has ascended to godhood according to a majority of the shaman and in her honor a new mask has been carved to be laid upon her grave, one devoid of all details, a true faceless mask for a faceless queen.\n\nSeveral rumors are floating around the clans, such as that she has married one of the three brothers, with shamans bickering about which one it could be. She is quickly becoming the preferred deity for all Shuvüüsh women as they pray to her for guidance.\n\n§R The Faceless Queen is now available as a personal deity to all QUEENS who control her temple in Zougzengom.§!"
 shuvuush.2.a:0 "A new god for all Shuvüüsh"

 shuvuush.3.t:0 "Arable Land in Shuvüüshudi"
 shuvuush.3.d:0 "(Placeholder) new developments in irrigation and land-tilling has allowed for iron plows to break the tough soil of Gozengun, resulting in an extremely arable clime developing from what once was grasslands. This will cause a great conflict between traditional, nomadic ways of life and new settled culture"
 shuvuush.3.a:0 "Unimplemented Beyond This Point"
 
 shuvuush.4.t:0 "Elevating Clan Leaders To Nobility"
 shuvuush.4.d:0 "With the recent formalization of the Nobility Estate, the countless clan leaders are demanding titles and privileges similar to those the Gowon and Yan nobles enjoy. We have elevated the most prominent clan leaders, but we can opt to allow even lesser clan leaders to join the nobility, for a price."
 shuvuush.4.a:0 "Sell no additional titles"
 shuvuush.4.b:0 "Sell a few titles"
 shuvuush.4.c:0 "Sell a bunch of titles"
 shuvuush.4.e:0 "Sell a ridiculous amount of titles, and secretly give discounts to those who need it"
 
 shuvuush.5.t:0 "The Fear Of Yanshen"
 shuvuush.5.d:0 "Through our relentless conquest of some of the most vital cities of Yanshen, we have shown ourselves to be ultimately successful in any siege and any war. Their soldiers desert their posts when they see the dust kicked up by our hordes in the distance, their diplomats draft up conditional surrender documents before we even declare war, and their rulers beg one another for help against this neverending conquest.\n\nWe are truly the fear of Yanshen!"
 shuvuush.5.a:0 "Let them cower before us!"

 shuvuush.10.t:0 "Hekuudzoungh Festival"
 shuvuush.10.d:0 "(Old lore)Horse Race Tests. The Yomod Rüsh are on opposite migration patterns from the rest of us which means we only meet during the summer bonfires. Yearly migrations are interspered with longer five-year migrations where all the tribes congregate to compete against one another in tests of sport."
 shuvuush.10.b:0 "Our ruler shall participate"
 shuvuush.10.c:0 "Our heir shall participate"
 shuvuush.10.e:0 "We shall observe"

 shuvuush.12.t:0 "Tournament Draws To An End"
 shuvuush.12.d:0 "And the winner is..."
 shuvuush.12.a:0 "[shuvuush_tournament_winner.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of [shuvuush_tournament_winner.GetName]!"
 shuvuush.12.b:0 "[shuvuush_tournament_winner.Heir.GetName] of [shuvuush_tournament_winner.GetName]!"
 
 shuvuush.13.t:0 "The Tsuista Khul Deal"
 shuvuush.13.d:0 "One of the more recent additions to the festival is the Hariigegh, where the rulers of every independent clan meet in a beautiful tent to eat great food and discuss matters of importance. [Y91.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Nuugdan Tsarai and [Y90.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] of Tsuista Khul have been discussing the future of the Tsuista Khul clan for quite some time now. [Y90.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] has requested our support conquering greener pastures for them.\n\nThe people of Tsuista Khul wish for better grazing lands for their livestock, and wish to wage war for the city of Jincheng and all the fertile land that lays before it. Should we promise them support, we can expect significant military cooperation from them, as they not only ready their military but indeed their entire population. To cement the deal [Y90.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] offers their close kins hand in marriage, should [Y91.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] desire it."
 shuvuush.13.a:0 "I accept both your child’s hand and your request for aid"
 shuvuush.13.b:0 "I accept your request for aid but must politely refuse the hand of your kin"

 shuvuush.100.t:0 "Life in the Steppes"
 shuvuush.100.desc:0 "It was a chilly morning in the steppe. The thaw had settled well for the year and the Yomod Rüsh were returning to the far north, ready to graze the terror-bird herds in the unforgiving permafrost. Things were slow for the most part; these were the few relatively easy days in a Shuvüüsh’s life throughout a typical year. A perfect day for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the [Root.Heir.GetTitle] to go out into the forested wilderness before the tribe had to move southwards. With the first light of dawn, they rode out of camp on their trusty terror-birds - both younglings, as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s last one had recently passed from old age. The two of them spent the entire morning bonding, terror-birds never out of their sight, as losing both could mean days until a search party finds them. Be it chasing down prey on their trusty steeds or stalking the local fauna on foot, they made sure to savour these last days of relaxation before the harsh winter of the steppe knocked at their door once more.\nCome dusk, it was - alas - time to return to camp, and the pair went on to mount their steeds. The [Root.Heir.GetTitle] arrived first, only to find a maskless man near the younger of the terror-birds, the other creature seemingly on edge by his presence, yet curiously unmoving, as if frozen by fear. Before [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] could react, [Root.Heir.GetTitle], found [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] on the ground with the man gnawing at his [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] mask, trying to pry it out, screaming on top of [Root.Heir.GetHerHim], writhing in agony at his apparent failure at ripping off the [Root.Heir.GetTitle]’s face. Suddenly, a horrible shriek was heard and the man - evident now that it was a facestealer - retreated, visibly wounded, into the foliage, the horrible sound slowly being drowned out by the forest. It was the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s timely intervention that saved [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] that day. Sadly, the same could not be said for the [Root.Heir.GetTitle]’s beloved steed. The sun had completely set by that time and the pair was returning to camp on one terror-bird.\n“Don’t get too attached, kid. You‘ll see a lot of them die in your lifetime”. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] consoled [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] teary-eyed child as best as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could. They had both learnt a valuable lesson that day. They are now..."

 shuvuush.100.f:0 "Storytellers with one more tale"

 shuvuush.101.t:0 "The Host of Hate"
 shuvuush.101.d:0 "Spirits have been moving south en masse for a couple full moons now. The clan’s Shamans have their hands completely tied with these migrations. Some were moving towards the Dakilbege Nuk lake, seeking the protection of its powerful Water Spirit, others even farther, aiming to offer their services to the Spirit-Farms. Upon being asked why they were fleeing, the answer was always the same.\nThey had appeared in droves. A lost raiding party? An unlucky Yomod Rüsh family? Facestealers rarely operate in large groups; their gluttony for chi and their despise for anonymity drives them towards solitude. It matters little what event led to this unlikely emergence, for what really matters is the immediate termination of this spiritual cancer that plagues the land. After much deliberation, and the advising of the most senior of Shamans, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] decided that this host of facestealers had to be disbanded. The Shamans argued it is more effective to take them out now rather than risk them spreading out in solitude.\n\nIt had been decades since a Shuvüüsh hunting host this large was assembled, numbering a dozen or so Shamans, with a couple of senior Death Priests clad in black robes and pitch-black masks among them. The smell of jasmine and juniper lingered in the air to such an extent that even the older terror-birds were visibly irritated by it. It is a blessing that the clan finds itself in a position to carry out such an important preemptive strike against the agents of pure evil."
 shuvuush.101.a:0 "Don the black masks, ignite the jasmine! Tonight, we ride."

 shuvuush.102.t:0 "To Live On"
 shuvuush.102.d:0 "”We lost a lot of good men. I was lucky to survive; if it was not for Baige I would not have made it out alive. You would have had to forget me, and our children would too. The things were far more numerous than anyone expected. We needed more Shamans with us. I knew we would need more. All fought bravely and in the end the Shepherd gave us victory. I do not think we’ll see any more facestealers this far east for a long time.”\n\n“Temul, you seem troubled. You need to forget the dead. Come, let’s go to the feast. Their sacrifice was not in vain; focus on that and that alone. Forget, Temul, you need to for-”\n\n“My father was there. I saw him with my own two eyes. I kept reminding myself that it was not him, it IS. NOT. HIM. I focused on the hollow black eyes and the gaping mouth, as the elders had told us to do in cases such as these. It was not him. I averted my gaze, turned to fight another, but the distraction was enough to put my life on the line for a moment. It was not him. This is the last I speak of him. Don your mask, Bayara, let’s go outside. I’ll bring the little ones.”\n\nTemul pondered: what if he had died that day? How could the kids forget him? At least they are still young; he didn’t have the same luxury. How could one forget his own father?"
 shuvuush.102.a:0 "Come, Temul, tonight we celebrate the future of our [Root.GovernmentName]"

 shuvuush.103.t:0 "The Advice of the Present"
 shuvuush.103.d:0 "It had been a while since the city had come under Shuvüüsh control. The cities of the Gowon were not completely alien to the riders of the steppe, despite centuries of their absence as rulers of the land. Border raids were frequent, and occasional forays deep into Gowon, all the way to the great spirit-walls of the coastal settlements, were far from uncommon. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was strolling through the city accompanied by the clan’s most senior Death Priest, a White Shaman and nine other riders from among [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] most trusted, a retinue most typical for a Kaasheg. Along with them, riding on horseback, was a grey-haired man, heir to one of the most powerful estates of the city. He had introduced himself to the Kaasheg shortly after the city’s conquest and had offered to show [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] around and induct [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a bit into the customs and traditions of the local populace. The streets were bustling with people and spirits alike - the spirits visibly cringed at the sight of a Death Priest. Opulent houses flanked the roads on both sides, seemingly taunting the riders with the thought of a more comfortable life. It was in a street such as this that the grey-haired man was offered a place in the Kaasheg’s court. Perhaps our neighbours can be proven useful after all."

 shuvuush.998.a:0 "Hold the line!"

 shuvuush.1001.t:0 "Facestealers Stir!"
 shuvuush.1001.d:0 "Like a fire, sparking from coals. Like the wind picking up before a great storm. Like an arrow, loosed but yet to find its target.\n\nEvery so often, the Facestealers begin to stir, becoming active in much larger numbers than normal. Such a time has come again, and [Root.GetName] must rise to meet it. Death lays in our future, and soon."

 #Y91_tuiista_jaal_horde_title:0 "Tsuista Khul Horde"
 #Y91_tuiista_jaal_horde_desc:0 "Ever since the great Kusheng Nurgai Bagaatun united the three major clans, diplomats have been trying to increase the cohesion of the clans. This has however proven difficult as the Shuvüüsh greatly value both freedom and tradition. Perhaps the upcoming Hekuudzoungh Festival planned for 1450 can bring forth some change."
 #Y91_jindeshi_valley_title:0 "Jincheng Valley"
 #Y91_jindeshi_valley_desc:0 "It is now time for us to secure a new land for our subjects, to let their livestock graze and their warriors raze. Let us conquer these lands and fulfil our promise."
 #Y91_razer_of_upper_yanshen_title:0 "Razer of Upper Yanshen"
 #Y91_razer_of_upper_yanshen_desc:0 "We should aid the Tsuista Khul in conquering the surrounding urban centers, as this would bring great wealth to both of our clans and bring us one step closer to both dominating Yanshen and strengthening our bond with our subject."
 #Y91_integrating_the_tuiista_jaal_title:0 "Integrating the Tsuista Khul"
 #Y91_integrating_the_tuiista_jaal_desc:0 "If we are to rule these lands with a firm grip, we must integrate our subjects into a single administration; no exceptions can be made, not even for our ancestral brethren.\n\nIt is time to convince the tribal elites to accept our demands for reform and buy them out."
 #Y91_freeing_ogre_subjects_title:0 "The Aikogeoke Dispute"
 #Y91_freeing_ogre_subjects_desc:0 "For a long time, Tsuista Khul herders and farmers have tried to settle the harsh land of Aikogeoke, but they were always repelled by the Oni. \n\nNow that the Tsuista Khul are migrating southward, it is now up to us to try and gain land from the demons. Let us show our little brother how its done!"
 #Y91_start_oni_genocide_title:0 "First Oni Purge"
 #Y91_start_oni_genocide_desc:0 "The time has come to purge these horned monsters; to this end we should lay siege to their capital and destroy their seat of power.\n\n§ROur advisors are drafting plans to use the Kamtarhid and Shamadhan minorities on the historical border with the Command to set up vassal states, when the purge is completed. As such, they advise against attempting to make those border provinces a core part of our administration.§!"
 #Y91_clearing_the_demons_title:0 "Last Oni Purge"
 #Y91_clearing_the_demons_desc:0 "We must make sure that historians will not refer to the upcoming years as the second Oni purge, but rather as the last Oni purge - no Oni can remain in the hills when we are done.\n\n§ROur advisors are drafting plans to use the Kamtarhid and Shamadhan minorities on the Ogre side of the historical border with the Command to set up vassal states; as such they advise against attempting to make those border provinces a core part of our administration.§!"
 #Y91_prepare_seconds_title:0 "Prepare Seconds"
 #Y91_prepare_seconds_desc:0 "Yemàjinun and the fortress of Xuanbik have been described by clan leaders as vital acquisitions to the realm. No longer do the hilly lands and the forts bar our Terrorbird riders from conquering the Jiangyang - instead, they now fulfil a vital logistical role to aid it.\n\nSuch a delicious meal simply means we must go for seconds."
 #Y91_fields_for_the_fearless_title:0 "Fields for the Fearless"
 #Y91_fields_for_the_fearless_desc:0 "The Shuvüüsh people bordering the lands of Jiantsiang have tried to let sneak their livestock into their fertile fields on more than one occasion. We should take these fields for our people, so that they may prosper."
 #Y91_along_the_coast_title:0 "Along The Coast"
 #Y91_along_the_coast_desc:0 "The path to the legendary city of Tianlou is one we must walk as a people. Only then will we truly flourish. To that end we should conquer along the lands of the coastal republics, where resistance is minimal and the lands are flat."

 #Y91_capture_facestealer_desc:0 "If we are to rid the Khaashalg desert of those wretched facestealing spirits and obtain vengeance for our ancestors, we must first capture one so we can study it.\n\nTo that end we should assemble a team of experts to capture one. We will need war-shamans, foreign mages, Rünsukhi guides, and an infantry regiment to protect them in the unforgiving desert."
 #Y91_kill_facestealer_title:0 "Killing a Facestealer"
 #Y91_kill_facestealer_desc:0 "Killing the captured facestealer has proven harder than previously thought. It truly seems that Jaal was a god even in life, being able to slay one singlehandedly. Even a team of shamans and foreign mages have proven inadequate to slay the spirit.\n\nSome of the foreign mages speak of so-called Spirit Hunters, from Xianjie. We should seek them out, and borrow their expertise."
 #Y91_facestealer_killers_title:0 "A New Type Of Soldier"
 #Y91_facestealer_killers_desc:0 "If we are to wage war against the facestealers, we shall need to train our own spirit hunters. Let us make the necessary investments."

 #Y91_clear_mountain_runsukhi_title:0 "Cleanse Tolcuug hills"
 #Y91_clear_mountain_runsukhi_desc:0 "The people of Tolcuug and Bhalooxi look at the land west of them with envy. The Rünsukhi land we have cleansed of the vile Facestealers is becoming more liveable every week.\n\nThere are almost no Facestealers left there, and as a result there are less sandstorms and there is less death. The people of the Tolcuug hills now desperately wish for the same. We should prepare the armies."
 #Y91_clear_egoongaam_runsukhi_title:0 "Cleanse Egoongaam"
 #Y91_clear_egoongaam_runsukhi_desc:0 "The Egoongaam clan of the most northern reach of our domain, separating us from the horsemen, has petitioned us to rid them of the Facestealers, like we did for their kinsmen."

 #Y91_clear_lakefolk_runsukhi_desc:0 "The lands of the Soolinúk are both the most fertile and the most plagued by the Facestealers. The Soolinúk clan claims to know where they come from, saying that the closer you get to the Baztaishaak Mountains, the more Facestealers you see, especially near the central mountain.\n\nThey beg us to rid them of their Facestealers and afterwards seek out a potential point of origin in the mountains."
 #Y91_into_the_mountain_title:0 "Into The Mountain"
 #Y91_into_the_mountain_desc:0 "It is time to amass our armies at the pass the Soolinúk clan mentioned, the one where the Facestealers go into and come out of, which we have had patrols cover ever since we cleansed the Khaashalg desert.\n\nThe Rünsukhi have set up a logistical network for our troops to be supplied when they are guarding the pass, even in great numbers. We have trained more Spirit Hunters, hired foreign mages, trained both our shamans and our men, and with a powerful mage [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to lead the expedition, morale will be higher than ever. We are ready - it is time to get our revenge."
 #Y91_lucky_scales_title:0 "A Blue Chance"
 #Y91_lucky_scales_desc:0 "The grand city of Jiangdu and its government once aided the Zhiqian in holding back our hordes, so with the fall of Xuanbik it was believed they would become our nemesis... \n\nNothing is less true; A rebellion of peasants has tore apart their realm and their military has suffered losses to a point where they cannot hope to reclaim stability without aid.\n\nTo them this is a disaster, to us, it is an opportunity. The self-declared peasant republic of Lanjinhui feigns strength and stability, but its institutions are weak, and its allies few. The only protection they have are their pitchforks and their unrulyness. If we are to either strike a deal with the old government in Jiangdu or make plans ourself, we can easily conquer this fertile farmland."
 #Y91_jiangdu_reborn_title:0 "Jiangdu Reborn"
 #Y91_jiangdu_reborn_desc:0 "One way or the other, we have done what had to be done to gain control over the region that once belonged to Jiangdu. Now is the time to set up a local government and look further inward."

 #Y91_nostalgic_fields_title:0 "Nostalgic Fields"
 #Y91_nostalgic_fields_desc:0 "In our attempt to cut through the Yansheni and reach Feiten from two sides we have come across a strangely familiar sight. Endless fields of sands and shrubbery, but these fields are uncannily salty.\n\nIndeed, a lake devoid of all water lies before us. Our troops are wel-trained to fight in lands this flat, so the western approach to Feiten will soon be open!"
 #Y91_the_flanking_title:0 "The Flanking"
 #Y91_the_flanking_desc:0 "With the conquest of the drained lake of Hongnguan and the subjugation of Tianlou behind us, we can threaten Feiten from two sides and cut the Yansheni world in half."

 #Y91_plan_danggun_invasion_desc:0 "The Gowon people have long been subjects to the followers of Oedek; alas they have fallen to rebellions. It is time to reconquer these lands for our people and exploit its riches.\n\nLet us infiltrate their garrisons and collect information on their military. Once this is done we can crush them, together with the followers of Oedek - only this time they will never successfully rebel!"

 #Y91_at_the_jiangdu_gate_desc:0 "If we were to control either the fields of Ciying or those of Dacha, no river would stand between us and Jiangdu. With only a gate and a few thousand weak Yansheni stopping us, we will take the spoils of the city with ease."
 #Y91_integrating_jiangdu_title:0 "Integrating Jiangdu"
 #Y91_integrating_jiangdu_desc:0 "The city of Jiangdu has eluded us for a few years, but now it is firmly within our grasp. As we conquer cultural hub after cultural hub, it is becoming evident that we are indeed the third conquerors of these lands. Only we don't plan to crumble."

 ### Unused missions
 #Y91_artificery_stimulus_title:0 "Artificery Stimulus"
 #Y91_artificery_stimulus_desc:0 "The artificers need more coal: that is the conclusion of the report which rests upon the desk of [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap]. If we wish to economically compete and bolster our state with thriving science, we shall have to invest heavily into coal production and seize the necessary lands, all the while granting the artificers the rights they need to set up manufactories across the empire."
 #Y91_damestear_demands_title:0 "Damestear Demands"
 #Y91_damestear_demands_desc:0 "The artificers have discovered that the Oni didn't settle in Shinukhorchi at random, it has now been confirmed that the Kuresgiju spring is indeed a meteor crater consisting high volumes of damestear.

 #Y91_precursor_relic_demands_desc:0 "With the demand for both coal and damestear met, and our country having a decent supply of precursor relics due to our control over Tianlou, one would think the artificers would be satisfied.\n\nYet it appears that this is not the case, for they desire an increase in the supply of precursor artifacts by ensuring that the deposits in Tianlou and on the island of Nakseseom are utilised to their logistical limit. The population of Tianlou will not be happy with us clearing whole neighborhoods to construct harvesting sites, and the islanders of Nakseseom have demanded we invest in their temples before we may expand industrial operations."

It is now up to us to unite these people within our growing empire.\n\nNot only do we have ample claim to the lands of Pinghoi as the true heir to Zhuhungwok, we also have the duty to protect all Yan people. Not to mention the strategically vital positions they hold, from which we could exert pressure upon the Rahen gulf."
 #Y91_distant_cousins_title:0 "Distant Sisters"
 #Y91_distant_cousins_desc:0 "With the former lands of Pinghoi now in our grasp, our distant sisters are once more united and we grow ever closer to an empire that represents all Yan.

"
 #Y91_yanification_program_title:0 "Yanification Program"
 #Y91_yanification_program_desc:0 "With our newfound outward gaze it has become evident that we must spread the language of the Yan far and wide within our realm, so that our empire may prevent separatism and ensure loyalty to the [From.Monarch.GetTitle]. It is time for a large campaign to fund language schools and incentives to start learning Yan."
 #Y91_runsukhi_yan_schools_title:0 "Rünsukhi Yan Schools"
 #Y91_runsukhi_yan_schools_desc:0 "The people closest to the Daxug in both loyalty and culture - besides the Yan - are without a doubt the Rünsukhi.

 #Y91_kamtarhid_yan_schools_desc:0 "Following the success of other Yanification programs in likeminded populations, it seems evident that we should set up a program to teach the Kamtarhid the way of Daxugo."
 #Y91_daxugification_title:0 "Daxugification"
 #Y91_daxugification_desc:0 "The mere act of Yanification is not enough; if we are to ensure our empire stands forever, we have no choice but to blur the lines between our Daxug people and the other Yan.\n\nThis will entail education reforms, Daxugifying their heroes, tales, and history.

 #Y91_great_zhinshi_campus_title:0 "Great Zinsii University"
 #Y91_great_zhinshi_campus_desc:0 "The Cannorians and gnomes have universities so large, it makes one wonder how advanced our people could be if our houses of learning rivalled their universities in size. Exactly this question our ministers of science are trying to answer through the plan to merge the houses of learning of Yangcheng into one huge university district. This plan will consist of multiple separate aspects, first a great campus will have to be constructed, then we will have to attract learned men from all over the country, Haless and beyond. Paying Cannorians and Gnomes to move to the new Zinsii university. If all goes well it shall grow into the greatest house of learning in Halann."

 ### The Guwamuud former dies and becomes a deity - previously unlocked the Bhengudaknar deity (sprite 44)
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.4.t:0 "The return of Bhengudak"
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.4.d:0 "With the reconquest of Gowon, ancient scriptures about a long forgotten god named Bhengudak have been unearthed from libraries all over the land. These documents speak of a god that used to watch over the previous iteration of Guwaamud for over 800 years, the god being the old former ruler of Guwaamud, ascended. This god has long been viewed as either dead or dormant.\n\nWith the recent departure of our previous ruler however, this is no longer the case. Shamans across the lands have reported that they can now commune with a new being, one which identifies itself as Bhengudakhnar, which means Bhengudak and child. It seems as if the two Shuvüüsh rulers that both have formed Guwaamud, both in the past and in the present, have now merged into a single living deity.\n\nAs shamans receive visions of their messages, a new mask has been carved to represent him. Both rulers were famous in life for subjugating those of other faiths and conquering with impunity; as such, those of us who would rather spread the faith by the terrorbird than the mouth are beginning to claim him as their guiding deity.\n\n§R Bhengudakhnar is now available as a personal deity to all monarchs who control his temple in Bhengutai.§!"
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.4.a:0 "An old god reborn, for all Shuvüüsh"

 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.5.d:0 "The spirit of the great former of Daxugo is so strong that when they passed, they seem to have joined the three brothers to guide our people through these tumultuous times. Daxüüsgen, more commonly known as Daxüü, the new god, who claims to hold the domains of reform and rationality is quickly gaining a following under the more religion-minded intellectuals of the empire.\n\nThe shamans have carved a new mask, representing a dragon, as the locals view it as the strongest of all beasts, and even the river our new capital lies on, is said to be housing a great spirit dragon. \n\n§RDaxüüsgen is now available as a personal deity to all monarchs who control their temple in Duzhekho.§!"

 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.13.t:0 "The Rünsukhi"
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.13.d:0 "Where the steppes of the Shuvüüsh meet the vast sands of the beyond, where our ancestors fled from almost 15 centuries ago, nothing good ever comes out. Occasionally a spirit wanders in from the desert and is turned away by local shamans.\n\nHowever, recently a group of families have arrived at the capital, claiming to be from the desert, and they're begging for food. Their old fashioned clothing, thick accents, and archaic vocabulary seem to support their claim.\n\nTheir clan leader says he represents a larger group of desert people, who all call themselves Rünsukhi. They say that the dry summers of the past few years have forced them to seek help. The rivers ran dry and they were forced to venture further from the homes to find food, losing many clansmen to the face stealing spirits in the process. They wish to join our great nation; they desire to purchase food from our markets and they claim to have access to gold mines and salt lakes to pay for it. All he asks for their loyalty is some relief food to make it through these months."

They have heard of the benefits that came to the previous clan that has made contact with the Shuvüüsh and wish to also join our growing nation.\n\nHowever, their ground is more fertile than even ours, so they do not wish for food relief - instead the clan leaders demand recognition as an official clan."

 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.20.d:0 "With the demand for coal in our empire satisfied, the artificers begin pressuring the government for access to damestear.

We are urged time and time again by the artificers to secure more damestear deposits and to explore rumors for potential deposits."
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.20.a:0 "We shall consider these requests"
 
 ### This was an event that unlocked the deity Manjang (sprite 47, today Nurgai)
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.27.t:0 "The Manjang Cult"
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.27.d:0 "As our grip on the island of Nakseseom has been strengthening for the past few months, we have been receiving words from our administrators on the island through our naval routes that the isle has a sizable religious cult.\n\nThey follow the ancient teachings of a man named Manjang, who united the Gowon long ago. On the mainland he is primarily seen as a historical figure, but on this isle he is seen as a god. The locals claim he watches over them and they have erected a large circular wooden shrine around his final resting place, where he died of old age after uniting his homeland and negotiating a peace between the spirits and the humans on the isle.\n\nIt wasn't long before some of our officials on the isle had their own personal shrines of him in their houses and soon after our shamans sent a delegation to try and communicate with him. They came back claiming he is a strong ascended spirit, worthy of veneration as he has the wisdom to unite both spirits and humans. They set out to carve a mask and establish a new cult through our lands.\n\n§R Manjang is now available as a personal deity to all monarchs who control his shrine in Nakseseom.§!"

 ### Facestealer mission branch starter
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.40.t:0 "Facestealer Captured!"
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.40.d:0 "The expedition sent into the land of the Rünsukhi has finally returned, significantly fewer in men and faces, but with an unmistakable creature in tow.\n\nThe same type of spirit that doomed our ancestors many centuries ago, now captured, through the effort of many shamans working together to bind the spirit into captivity. Word of our accomplishment has traveled to the spirit hunters of Xianjie."
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.40.a:0 "A breakthrough, but this is far from over"

 ### Next Facestealer mission
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.41.t:0 "In The Footsteps Of Jaal"
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.41.d:0 "On the Day of Ashen Skies, Jaal famously slew a Facestealer, with nothing more than his mask and pure rage. It seems that he is no longer the only one.\n\nThe shamans who had captured the facestealer in the land of the Rünsukhi have been attempting to kill it for a long time, and they have finally succeeded. Apparently the breakthrough came after they were visited by renowned spirit hunters from Xianjie, who had heard of the capture and wished to observe this type of spirit."
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.41.a:0 "We need to train men like these for our own army"
 
 ### Next Facestealer mission
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.42.t:0 "Saanorgegh Spirit Hunters"
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.42.d:0 "The Szitu spirit hunters, together with our most experienced shamans and best mages, have been working on training more men and women to be capable of defeating spirits in combat.\n\nEvery week more troops are deemed ready to fight against the Facestealers. The men are eager to test their newfound abilities out in the desert and obtain vengeance for their ancestors."
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.42.a:0 "It is time for a war long overdue"
 
 ### Final Facestealer mission
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.44.t:0 "The Dreaded Valley"
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.44.d:0 "As [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] mounted [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] terrorbird with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] most trusted generals and shamans nearby, they began making their way through the dreaded valley, surrounded by thousands upon thousands of men, some on terrorbirds, some on horses. Some our own, some belonging to the Rünsukhi, and others mages from Yanshen, hired with bags of crowns.\n\nThey all have two things in common: they are all wearing masks and they are all filled with fear, whether they show it or not. After a few minutes the first duststorm appears, a small whirlwind drawing near the regiment in the front. When the dust settles, a Facestealer is seen attempting to pull off the masks of some men, as others pelt it with projectiles and spells. Soon the spirit crumbles to sand, becoming one with the desert and the regiment continues to move forward, sustaining minor casualties.\n\nThe army walks for a whole hour without anything happening, when suddenly a sandstorm grows in the distance, nearing fast. As it draws closer, it gets bigger and bigger, as smaller whirlwinds join together. Some men ready their weapons, others adjust their masks. A shaman tries to calm his terrorbird, a mage turns around and starts running... [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes a deep breath and prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] very soul."

 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.45.b:0 "A Facestealer claw about to tear [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face off"
 
 ### Facestealer Good Ending
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.46.t:0 "The Lions Den"
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.46.d:0 "As [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] got up, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] realised the battle was won. One of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal guards explains that [Root.Monarch.GetName] took a nasty hit from a Facestealer, the largest one anyone had ever seen, right to the face, right before [Root.Monarch.GetName] blasted a dozen Facestealers to their demise and lost consciousness.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] looked around the battlefield it was obvious casualties were high, but victory was certain. An hour later the last wounded man was on a cart home and the army pushed onward to the mountain, adamant to end this scourge once and for all.\n\nThe army approached the mountain and fought a few Facestealers here and there, emboldened by their previous victory, and it soon became clear they were protecting a cave entrance. [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] made [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] way inside, with their most experienced combatants in tow, a mage lighting the way with an illuminating spell and a full regiment behind her.\n\nAfter a few minutes of walking and dealing with a couple of Facestealers who shrieked at the group when they charged, like mothers defending their babies, the cave walls became home to a disturbing feature. Actual human faces were embedded into the wall, made from flesh and stuck in a permanent expression of pain and panic. As the party went further down into the cave, the density of these faces on the walls, ceiling and floor increased, until the faces were so plentiful the shamans had to discuss if continuing to trample on our ancestors was sacrilege or permitted.\n\nAfter what felt like an hour of walking over the faces of their dead kinsmen the cave finally widened into a final room, its walls completely filled with faces. In the center of the room were hundreds of small, almost childlike Facestealers, who gave little resistance to spirit hunters. It was finally over - the home of the Facestealers was now under human control. The Shamans agreed that the cave will be taken care of by them, to ensure no sacrilege is committed against the faces of our, or anyone's, ancestors. The army returned home victorious, but will anyone ever be the same?"

 ### Facestealer Bad Ending
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.47.t:0 "The Retreat"
 #flavor_nuugdan_tsarai.47.d:0 "As a Facestealer larger than any other ever seen tears the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] apart and rips off their face, a wave of fear spreads through the army. Men drop their fighting stance and run, riders are thrown from their birds and horses, formations break, shamans break down into prayer, and mages begin to teleport out. A spirit hunter hopelessly tries to hold the beast back, losing her head in the process.\n\nThe generals eventually manage to regain control of the army, but the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is already lost, and so is the day. Without purpose, the generals decide to return home, letting the Facestealers feast on the corpses - hopefully all the new faces will satiate them for generations to come."
