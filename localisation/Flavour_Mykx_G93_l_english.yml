 G93_replenish_scourge_fleet_title:0 "Replenish Scourge Fleet"
 G93_replenish_scourge_fleet_desc:0 "What sailed with Mykx could hardly be called a fleet; it ranged from fishing boats to raiding ships, vessels that only by a miracle were still afloat, and the best of Viakkoc. The voyage forged the crews into a community and ensured only the best crafts or sailors arrived on Aelantir. Now that it has arrived, it's time to refit, repair, and prepare for this new world."

 G93_the_troll_toll_title:0 "The Troll Toll"
 G93_the_troll_toll_desc:0 "“The ships that sail to privateers on Trollsbay always return full of plunder and talk of never-ending unprotected convoys, big merchant ships with no canons, of looking at the horizon and always seeing new targets. Let's organize a proper privateer flotilla instead of sending small, disorganized groups. A proper supplied and armed fleet will be able to plunder every inch of profit from that route."

 G93_infrastructure_for_our_navy_title:0 "Infrastructure for Our Navy"
 G93_infrastructure_for_our_navy_desc:0 "Despite what we want, it’s impossible for all of our population to be raiding or pillaging. Someone needs to make the sails for the ships, gather wood for repairs and new vessels, food for us and even for the slaves, they still need to eat, sometimes even the drugs we brought are starting to run out. We will need an investment and offer some incentives to make it attractive for our citizens to stay on land and work there."

 G93_ruined_sea_monopoly_title:0 "Ruined Sea Monopoly"
 G93_ruined_sea_monopoly_desc:0 "Outsiders might think we sustain entirely off of raiding, but nothing is less accurate. Despite this possibility being considered a utopia for our citizens, it is sadly impossible. For every crew of a raiding ship, we need to have doubles on land, to feed the slaves, repair the vessel, prepare the ammunition, a priest to make the proper sacrifices to the demons, and a chemist to make the drugs the craft consumes.\n\nThis infrastructure needs constant trade between our far-flung possessions on the Ruined Sea. Taking control of the region's natural harbors and strategic islands would make this commerce easier and much more profitable."

 G93_docks_for_our_ships_title:0 "A Dock for Our Ships"
 G93_docks_for_our_ships_desc:0 "Our nation needs a grand dockyard; we are surrounded by sea at all sides, we need a way to repair our ships fast and make new ones just as quickly, our capital would be the best location for it, as it has the best infrastructure and geography.\n\nThat was the official speech, my Lord Captain. There are other reasons for us to build this massive shipyard in our capital, which would also give us the most significant military capacity of all the different parts of our country. If any islands rebel or a captain decides to do like Mykx, we could build a new flotilla with this shipyard. Also, more business will be conducted here; if loyalty or fear don’t put the other admirals in line, the fear of not enjoying trade with us might."

 G93_set_the_sun_on_saamir_title:0 "Set the Sun on Saamir"
 G93_set_the_sun_on_saamir_desc:0 "The Bulwari had a lot of dreams, too build on a new land, untouched by the malevolent dark, free of persecution, free of violence, where all faithful could live, a Utopia on a new continent. Unfortunately, reality can make a dream into a nightmare; they were weak prey for the pirates of Mykx. Ironically, this was the pirates' dream, entire days spent fighting, plundering, taking drugs, having no care for tomorrow, and living only in the present; life was an eternal raid for them."

 G93_wealth_of_the_north_title:0 "Wealth To The North"
 G93_wealth_of_the_north_desc:0 "Back in Viakkoc, all privateers knew that the true wealth was found to the north, on Cannor, but their coasts were protected and distant from our ports. Now we find Cannorians to our north, whose coasts are rife with wealth, but this time, their coasts aren’t protected, and our ports are much closer. Let’s remind the Cannorians why they should fear what comes from the sea.”"

 G93_raiders_of_noruin_title:0 "Raiders Of Noruin"
 G93_raiders_of_noruin_desc:0 " Raiding is not barbaric; for the Mykx privateers with decades of experience and knowledge, it’s a science. First, you map the region, the sea lanes, the strength of the winds, the tides; every aspect of the sea is recorded. Then, the process of identifying the riches in the region needs to be cataloged. Who should be raided first? Are the spoils in danger of spoiling? How are they going to react to the attacks? Will they run, stay to fight, or hide their treasures? Hundreds of small variables needed to be accounted for to make sure that every coin, every slave, and every trade good could be taken as quickly and as easily as possible. So, with the mapping of the coast of Noruin, we have all the plans and preparations for the sacking of the region. We just need our “scientists” to show why they are the best on Halann at the science of raiding."

 G93_collecting_our_bearings_title:0 "Collecting Our Bearings"
 G93_collecting_our_bearings_desc:0"Hey, do you have any idea where we are?\n\nYes, we are in the South of Ixikkaz, now pass me the pipe.\n\nWe have been in Aelantir for months. I don’t think the pipe is doing well for you. Snort this instead.\n\nAre you sure we are even in Aelantir? Do we even have a map of the region? We should do some mapping. Also, I stopped snorting before the Lilac Wars began; it made me lose track of time.\n\nYes, I will send some ships to make a new map. Also, the Lilac Wars ended decades ago; I was not even born, and you are younger than me.\n\nSo, if snorting wasn’t what made me lose track of time, there's no need not to use it then.”"

 G93_securing_our_surroundings_title:0 "Securing Our Surroundings"
 G93_securing_our_surroundings_desc:0 "On Akasik, Viakkoc held all land and sea that the sun could touch; still, the pack always dreamed of controlling all the coasts of Divenhal Sea. The Corsair Kings would stare at the map of the area and dream of one day holding control of it.\n\nMykx stared at the map of the Ruined Sea, and she understood completely why the Viakkoc rulers did that. While looking at the islands, she promised herself that all of it would one day belong to her, but first, she needed to start somewhere. The lands around their landing would make a good base. Like a wave, her realm would grow small until it consumed the entire Ruined Sea."

 G93_fate_of_the_calasanni_title:0 "Fate of the Calasanni"
 G93_fate_of_the_calasanni_desc:0 "The Calasanni dream is one of stasis, to control the ship lanes as a middleman, a parasite offering protection for mainly itself and supplying slaves monopolizing the trade to offer to the plantations. So dedicated to this plan, they forgot that if you want to offer protection, you'd better be prepared for a conflict. It appears that we will test them if they are"

 G93_conquer_docks_plan_title:0 "Conquered Docks Plan"
 G93_conquer_docks_plan_desc:0 "Our enemies are many, our allies are just ourselves, for every soldier we have, our enemies have a hundred in comparison. Our only advantage is at sea; we must reactivate the docks and shipyards we conquered for our rivals, and we must be able to supply ships faster than our enemies can. We are a nation born at the sea, and our fate will be defined at the sea, and for that, we need ships, and we need them quickly."

 G93_the_grand_republic_title:0 "The Grand Republic"
 G93_the_grand_republic_desc:0 "The Sacrifice Pyre was so full, I saw some priests give mercy to some of the sacrifices. There are so many drugs on the market that I see some users sharing among each other, and we have so much food that even the slaves are getting fat. Our fleet is strong, our realm is vast and secured, and it is time to let the rest of the world know about our prosperity. It is time for a feast of epic proportions to commemorate the good times!"

 G93_fate_of_the_dwarves_title:0 "Fate of the Dwarves"
 G93_fate_of_the_dwarves_desc:0 "Dwarves are always a tough nut to crack when raiding, their cities are always well defended, and their militias are always well supplied and trained. It matters not; they are a plunder too tasty not to take a bite, a population well trained, that can resist the elements with insufficient food or rest, and that has a tradition of hard work. They will be the perfect slaves for our fields or to sell."

 G93_graxarr_everpyre_title:0 "Graxarr Everpyre"
 G93_graxarr_everpyre_desc:0 " The Kult has already offered many boons to our nations without much help; now the priests are saying they can offer even more if given help. They want to construct a Pyre atop the temple that feeds wood and bodies continuously. The location would allow them to host most of the states' sacrificial rituals. Plus, it would allow the Kult to keep close oversight and to counter any unwanted side-effects, mainly any demonic rifts that might appear, a normal apparition on rituals of the Xhaz."

 G93_every_ship_an_observer_title:0 "Every Ship an Observer"
 G93_every_ship_an_observer_desc:0 "A law is just a piece of paper if there is nobody to enforce it. To make sure our new articles and statements are followed, we should put an official on the most important vessels. It wouldn’t be too hard to make our captains accept that, as we will tell them that the law was made to control their rivals and that on their ship, our observers are being lenient."

 G93_articles_of_piracy_title:0 "Articles of Piracy"
 G93_articles_of_piracy_desc:0 "The demand for a comprehensive set of rules, guidelines, and laws didn’t come from Mykx but came from the bottom, from the lowest sailors to the highest captain demanded then. The population of the new republic was the freest they had ever been, but they were also at the most dangerous moment of their lives. With no laws, murder, theft, and blatant corruption could all be practiced openly. Terrible for businesses and for the security of any individual on Mykx, so the population was keen for a constitution to be written, as long as they had their say on it logically."

 G93_the_second_congregation_title:0 "The Second Congregation"
 G93_the_second_congregation_desc:0 "The first congregation was a tremendous success, now the citizens of Mykx don’t walk around armed because of fear of being attacked by any stranger, they walk armed because it’s the fashion. Still, the finer points have not been combed. Was there going to be a separation of powers? Was that needed beyond the judiciary? What role would the Xhaz Priests have on this nation? How do you define the spoils of a sack? All finer discussions that this second congregation will hopefully clarify."

 G93_window_to_the_far_west_title:0 "Window to the Far West"
 G93_window_to_the_far_west_desc:0 "Pirates are like all creatures, believers in patterns. When they sailed west from Viakkoc and landed in Ilzin Mykx, they found boundless wealth to exploit. They found even more wealth when they sailed west from Ilzin Mykx and found Vanburia. Then, for the time, they sailed west from Vanburia and raided Eordand and Kheionai. This time, as before, they found wealth beyond imagining. Now, if three times was the charm, they want to go further west, beyond the ocean and the storms, to find even greater wealth."

 G93_vanbury_gold_title:0 "Vanbury Harbour"
 G93_vanbury_gold_desc:0 "Despite what appears, pirates are not barbarous beasts with no appreciation for science and the finer arts; they just have a more money-focused approach. When scouting the island named Vanburia. They realized it was chosen because it had a natural harbour so deep that not a single wave could hit it. So with their money approached, they realized it would be a perfect dock for even bigger raiding and later trade, so they deeply respected and appreciated the Vanburials for choosing this place, so much that they would take it for them."

 G93_scourge_of_kheionai_title:0 "Scourge of Kheionai"
 G93_scourge_of_kheionai_desc:0 "The Kheionai were weird for the pirates; they were blue and their customs were very alien, but they used gold, practiced slavery, and had precursor relics, so Mykx, with their famous tolerance, decided to raid them the same as all other groups. They would just need to take control of some key islands."

 G93_scourge_of_south_aelantir_title:0 "Scourge of South Aelantir"
 G93_scourge_of_south_aelantir_desc:0 "Mykx Pirates were a deep believer in equal opportunity for all. They raided cities and entire nations, and they later would sell goods to them. This process would be very keen on the South Aelantir, where the pirate ships could either be a boon for a local city economy or its total downfall. So to expand their capacity of this double action on the region, they would invest in making more trading posts in the region."

 G93_gate_to_the_west_title:0 "Gate to the West"
 G93_gate_to_the_west_desc:0 "If Vanburia didn’t have a good port, it would still be important because of its key location. It would still be a significant acquisition if it weren’t in a key location but had a good port. As the situation now presents, it’s on a critical trade connection and has a superb port. We need it to be ours to exert our influence upon the western part of Aelantir."

 G93_all_hell_under_a_flag_title:0 "All Hell Under a Flag"
 G93_all_hell_under_a_flag_desc:0 "We have brought ruin to both North and South Aelantir, we have marched west to the cities of Haless and ransacked their great palaces, we have moved east and strangled Cannor's trade. When Halann's population thinks of pirates and raiders, it’s our banner they think of; when they think of the scourge that comes from the sea, it’s the name of our country that comes out of their mouths. Now, the seas and coasts know only one rule, ours."

 G93_banished_trade_title:0 "Banished Isles"
 G93_banished_trade_desc:0 "With our horizon broadened after the Grand Republic of Mykx declaration, we know that we solved the problems at the regional level and internally. We want more land to conquer and to flourish; even if we wish for a bigger ship and more raiders, we need more land. As such, the Banished Isles should belong to us. The coastal plains, inland jungles, and natural harbours will soon be part of Mykx and help grow our nation."

 G93_scourge_of_eordand_title:0 "Scourge of Eordand"
 G93_scourge_of_eordand_desc:0 "Eordand has a rich coast, which sports coastal cities that export precursor relics, a trade good valuable beyond our wildest dreams. A sack of them would be worth the weight of a gnoll in gold in Cannor. These cities don’t appear to have sea defenses or a tradition of suffering from piracy. Let’s teach them why they should fear the sea and get rich with precursor relics at the same time."

 G93_blood_and_gold_initiative_title:0 "Blood and Gold Initiative"
 G93_blood_and_gold_initiative_desc:0 "The Blood and Gold Initiative is a proposed initiative that is very simple, as its name suggests, vast amounts of gold and even higher quantities of Demon’s Blood. For the gold, we would need to conquer every significant port in Aelantir and ramp up Demon's Blood production in astronomical proportions. Before such plans can be drafted, we must obtain enough experience in conquering foreign ports and perfecting Demon’s Blood production."

 G93_scourge_of_north_aelantir_title:0 "Scourge Of North Aelantir"
 G93_scourge_of_north_aelantir_desc:0 "Not a single region on the continent must be without a safe harbour for our smugglers. Neither distant enough that our raiders can’t reach, every port in Aelantir must be within our grasp, no matter how distant or frozen. When we have achieved that, we will truly be an unstoppable scourge for the northerners."

 G93_cannorian_crave_title:0 "The Cannorian Crave"
 G93_cannorian_crave_desc:0 "It’s amazing. Just like in Viakkoc, the more supply we offer, the more demand we get. It’s an aberration of all economic laws.\n\nThank you, Professor, but I don't understand what this supply and demand has to do with our trade with Cannor.\n\nThe more drugs and Narcotics we are selling to the cannibals, the more they want it; it’s a feedback loop that could, in theory, go on forever.\n\nSo if I got it, the more drugs we make, the more the Cannorians will want, then we will produce more, and they will want more, that cycle will continue forever?\n\nOf course, in theory, in practice, it’s constrained by the total Cannorian population, and we need to analyze our production and macroeconomics. Oh, she is gone; those pirates always leave at the end of my explanations ."

 G93_burning_rose_title:0 "Burning Rose"
 G93_burning_rose_desc:0 "The rose throne of Lencenor has for long been a thorn in our side, their ports get rich from trading goods and commerce that comes from Aelantir. Those riches rightfully belong to us, as the seas belong to those that have the strength to control it. We will show the Roses our strength."

 G93_research_demons_blood_title:0 "Research Demon's Blood"
 G93_research_demons_blood_desc:0 "The traders and smugglers of Mykx are always looking for new goods to export, be it slaves, precursor relics, narcotics or weapons. This Demon's Blood seems very profitable, cheap to make and sell at a high price. The producers say that even they got more investors, they could produce even more and that maybe they still uses for this product, yet to be researched. We should allocate more resources for it."

 G93_start_mass_production_title:0 "Start Mass Production"
 G93_start_mass_production_desc:0 "In order to start producing Demon's Blood in such a quantity that it can both supply our internal market and a potential external market, we need to secure vital resources, ramp up our resource production and redesign our trade port infrastructure. The big problem is that one of those resources is a rare type of mushroom procured from the Leechden. We should settle the area and make some slaves plantations to harvest more easily."


 G93_ruined_home_title:0 "Ruined Home"
 G93_ruined_home_desc:0 "“Many years ago, we fled from Viakkoc to search for a better place to achieve our dreams of a free republic with drugs, raiding, and slaves. We followed Lady Mykx across the seas until we reached a remote island where we founded our new home. Now said home rules the waves of the Ruined sea, yet little effort has been made to turn this place into a permanent home for our people. We still live as if we are ready to flee again; we should remedy that and turn this into a proper capital."

 G93_fire_of_our_own_title:0 "Fire of Our Own"
 G93_fire_of_our_own_desc:0 "Despite the Ruinborn Gnolls following the same religion of the mainland gnolls and some traditions such as slavery being key aspects of their society, they are radically different from their counterparts, even those in Viakkoc, from which they are descended. Ruinborn Gnoll lives are dedicated to the sea, drugs are a key aspect of their society, and their political system is a rare case of a Gnoll republic. What will the future bring as years pass and this new society diverges further from its cousins in the old world?\n\n      -Professor Lothar on Gnolls on Aelantir: A Case Study"

 G93_declare_scourge_of_all_seas_title:0 "True Scourge Of All Seas"
 G93_declare_scourge_of_all_seas_desc:0 "When ships sail on the Aelantir, they pay us not to raid them; every continent is known to our plunderers, privateers, and smugglers. Our drugs can be found from Cannor to the Lake Federation. We are the Scourge of All Seas, and it is time for everyone, including Viakkoc, who has falsely claimed that title for centuries, to feel that!"

 G93_captain_retiree_programme_title:0 "Captain Retirees"
 G93_captain_retiree_programme_desc:0 "It is not unheard of for a once great captain to fall into abject poverty due to injury, misfortune, or age and be forced to roam the streets, begging for coin. Such a phenomenon is a shame and a waste of experienced individuals. Despite not having the maniac scavenge mania of the Kvangahga, we still abhor wasting anything, especially talent. As such, a commission that can use those retired or mained captains has been gaining traction. They could use their knowledge as teachers, bureaucrats, analysts, researchers, advisors, and current captains would be even more daring as they know their future is secured even if they get a debilitating injury."

 G93_perfect_the_recipe_title:0 "Perfect the Recipe"
 G93_perfect_the_recipe_desc:0 "When we first got Demon´s Blood, we just tried to copy the recipe; now we're taking strides to improve it. We are questioning every step of the process, testing every new avenue or component. Why use a pig’s urine like the original recipe demanded? Maybe we should use Human Urine instead? Why not try to add potato peels instead? Do we even need blood on Demon’s Blood? Also, we probably should find a way not to use arsenic; we don’t want the users to die so quickly."

 G93_great_bone_citadel_title:0 "Great Bone Citadel"
 G93_great_bone_citadel_desc:0 "There is power on a body, despite the soul having left the body, bones and flesh itself are filled with raw potential, as such the Bone Citadel is as a structure with great potential, generations of corpses, a boom for our Kultists. Also early scous indicate that it is a place of great magical potential, but the local population will have to be 'dealt with' before the kult is willing to send anyone important. They too shall become part of the building they cherish so much."

 G93_the_citadel_expanded_title:0 "Expand the Citadel"
 G93_the_citadel_expanded_desc:0 "The Kultists are insatiable, despite the improvements and control of one of the most potent magical places. They still prepare plans for the Citadel to become greater than ever under the Cheshoshi's reign. The demons whisper that the rewards for constructing an even bigger locus of power will be the stuff of what dreams are made, or in our case, of what nightmares are made."

 G93_a_promise_fulfilled_title:0 "A Promise Fulfilled"
 G93_a_promise_fulfilled_desc:0 "The demons have made their demands and stated their rewards, no riddles, double-meaning, or treachery in their words. The absence of their usual games means they are taking this project seriously. The Kultits' projects for the ritual are unbelievable; in the hands of an unbeliever, it would be the ravings of a monster, sacrifices at a scale never seen before, torture and murder on a scale never seen before. Even if this all turns to nothing, the world will never see anything like it before."

 G93_form_the_marine_corps_title:0 "Form The Marine Corps"
 G93_form_the_marine_corps_desc:0 "Yes, pirates and raiders are not very good at fighting a prolonged battle on land, they still behave like they are on the sea, they drop one volley and rush to melee instead of reloading and staying in groups. But the land soldiers are so useless everywhere else, during transport, they get seasick, take ages to disembark the ships, and don’t know how to keep their gunpowder dry, and We have so few of them compared to sailors.\n\nWhy don’t we just train sailors to fight like soldiers? Should we call them soldiers of the sea?\n\nSo a Marine Soldier? \nNot so keen on the name, but I like the idea”"

 G93_build_the_naval_academy_title:0 "The Naval Academy"
 G93_build_the_naval_academy_desc:0 "With the Marine Corps, I still think the name sucks and we should change it, not the place Rilzuz formed. The gazes of our military reformers now fall upon the chaotic state of our navy. Our sailors have not had basic fire, climbing, or combat training, don’t we gangpress most of them? Thanks to Xhaz, they even fight on our side. Complaints are on another form, Rilzuz. It is okay for our slaves to be incompetent, for they just have to row, but our own sailors being untrained is an unnecessary disgrace. Military reformers wish the state to allot funds to establish a naval academy close to Ilzin Mykx, on Graxilzin. Don’t you own the land in all the places you suggest the Naval Academy be built, Orvaal? If you are reading this, Rilzuz, I am going to kill you."

 G93_swimming_exams_title:0 "Swimming Exams"
 G93_swimming_exams_desc:0 "Gnolls love water, despite that most of our population doesn’t know how to swim. They regularly do parties on the beach or on the middle of the ocean but their knowledge of proper swimming beside staying afloat is tenuous at best. We should do proper swimming classes, we should of course put the requirement to be sober and drug free for at least 6 hours, more then that would be impossible to find candidates."

 G93_kultic_reforms_title:0 "Kultic Reforms"
 G93_kultic_reforms_desc:0 "Unfortunately, news of our Republic's Successes has reached the Abyssal Plane; the Demons have heard about our riches and conquests. So now they are demanding more for their boons and gifts. Also, our Kult rituals are old and ironically outdated according to Xhaz Cultists from the Sarhal. We should strike on both fronts, offer even more to the Demons, and update our religious practices to get even more of our sacrifices."

 G93_expand_the_bureaucracy_title:0 "Expand The Bureaucracy"
 G93_expand_the_bureaucracy_desc:0 "When we arrived here, we were no more than a fleet. Orders and commands were simple: follow every order of Mykx. But now we are a burgeoning state; they are ministers, advisors, captains, and commanders. What is the chain of command? From whom do we follow Orders? Even an orgy or a raid has to have some organization to occur, so for the moment, we are administratively handicapped.\n\nThe solution is simple, but a nightmare for people like ours; we need a proper bureaucracy and bureaucrats. Yes, we are pirates, but we can’t be disorganized."

 G93_cannon_standardisation_title:0 "Cannon Standardisation"
 G93_cannon_standardisation_desc:0 "Gnolls are masters of scavenging and fixing what is broken, of finding a use even from the most useless junk. So it’s not surprising that in the Mykx state, even slaves were used to their highest capacity. Not working then to death, Gnolls hate waste, but to use everything a slave could give, in regards to the Dwarves, it was their ingenuity.\n\nYes, they made great slaves, but using them just on plantations was a waste. The Gnolls simply put them on what they did best, making weapons. Soon, the Canon's manufactories, led and organized by Dwarves, appeared all over the Pirate Republic. But how did the Gnolls ensure those Dwarves would use the weapons they made to rebel? By giving them the possibility of buying their own freedom and the right to own slaves. A slave society works by making the slave dream of being the slaver, not of being free."


 #Events
 mykx.1.t:0 "Calasanni Fate"
 mykx.1.d:0 "There is a moment of a siege, when the defenders realize it’s lost and the attackers know they won. At that moment, all sides lose their organization and cohesion and focus on two things: running to save your own hide or sack anything nailed to the ground. The Pirates were seconds away from that moment, when all order would disappear, at that moment the captain had a choice on what to do with the defeated:."
 mykx.1.a:0 "Sacrifice them all."
 mykx.1.b:0 "Let them row for us."
 mykx.1.c:0 "Let them toil our soil."
 mykx.1.e:0 "Sell them on the black market."

 mykx.2.t:0 "Gnoll Settlers In The Bend"
 mykx.2.d:0 "With the Calasanni unwilling to commit to these isles, as they have run away, being enslaved or dead, they are now ours. Despite our reputation, Gnolls can also be farmers; some of our people dream of being able to settle down, raise a farm, with some slaves to toil the fields and raise a family. They still take the occasional drugs and booze, of course, but they mainly desire the rural life.\n\nIt won’t be hard to attract some settlers from the mainland with the promise of free land and cheap slaves."
 mykx.2.a:0 "The Bend is ours."

 mykx.3.t:0 "Saamir Fate"
 mykx.3.d:0 "As our troops pilfer through the trinkets collected in Saamirbrar, by that fool Saamir and his followers, it quickly becomes clear that the true treasure is not in his coffers. They came to this land with a dream and had no actual land riches. At the moment, their only riches are their flesh, the people in their towns... What should be their fate?"
 mykx.3.a:0 "Sacrifice them all."
 mykx.3.b:0 "Let them row for us."
 mykx.3.c:0 "Let them toil our soil."
 mykx.3.e:0 "Sell them on the black market."

 mykx.4.t:0 "Gnoll Settlers In Saamiršes"
 mykx.4.d:0 "The followers of Saamir will now only control those isles below the ground, as fertilizers for the crops, the lucky ones will toil for us. As word spreads to the old world that we have fertile land, an ample amount of slaves, and we are not killing each other as the packs on the mainland do. More migrants than usual make the journey and begin aiding the settling effort. There are rumors that some Cannor Gnolls are even joining our ranks. "
 mykx.4.a:0 "Saamiršes is ours."

 mykx.5.t:0 "The Ruined Isles"
 mykx.5.d:0 "Let a Gnoll raid a ship or a town, and he will be fed for a week. Make a Gnoll a planter/farmer, and they will be fed for life. More and more of our people are choosing to settle down on the open, fertile lands around us instead of raiding. Should we invest in this trend? In the long term, we will build a strong economy and power base on the island. Some of our advisors claim we must strike while the iron is hot and conquer all enemies before we decide to settle."
 mykx.5.a:0 "Time to shift our priorities"
 mykx.5.b:0 "We must not overextend ourselves"

 mykx.6.t:0 "Graxarr Expedition"
 mykx.6.d:0 "When word from the explorers who first saw Graxarr Temple from the sea reached the government in Ilzin Mykx, they were ecstatic: A large Precursor structure still standing and untouched? The only thought that ran through the advisors in charge was GOLD. Tales, legends, and memories of entire packs killing each other or being raised to the apex of power thanks to finding one Precursor Relic in a raid or an archeological dig. A small number of voices said that yes, Gold was possible, at selling those relics, what about power? With the new technological advances and magical discoveries, a Precursor Relic could be the key to unimaginable power, leading to Gold. What they all agreed on at least was that they needed to organize an expedition to this Temple and fast."
 mykx.6.a:0 "Sell them on the black market."

 mykx.7.d:0 "Despite what appears, the most challenging part of a raid is the division of spoils: who should receive what? How do you divide for a sailor who stayed on the ship to maintain the cannons and shoot at the enemy, an important task, from another one who went personally to burn and steal the settlement? Thankfully, that is the job of our administrators and officials inside the ships; all the crew accept their presence and the taxes they enforce, as they know they will do the separation properly, taking account of all the different variables. This can mean a less bounty at the end, sure, but it assures all parties involved in the raid that they received their fair share and that only by acting inside our republic can they be assured they will be paid fairly. Plus, if disagreements occur, they can take it to court and have their case heard. Of course, this all involves bribes and threats, better than before, which was killing the disaffected party at night.\n\nThe new bounty division being established on our raiders' ship has brought a sense of stability and calm to the captains. They know they can be even more daring, as they know their crews aren’t a sea of hate and resentment ready to explode. Some are pushing for bigger and more distant raids; a new focus has been on the North, previously untouched by our ships. However, if we are to reach the wealth in the north, we need nearby safe havens from which our vessels can operate."

 mykx.8.d:0 "The grand feast was planned perfectly, the party wouldn’t be in one place in the Capital, but in its entirety, everyone was automatically invited. Even more lavishly, even the slaves were taken into account for the preparations, from the richest to the poor, all would be at the party of their lives. The food, gifts, drugs, the attractions, and of course, the giant sacrifices all required an infrastructure the same size as the city and of the highest level of finesse. The occasion demanded; it would be when the Grand Republic of Mykx would be declared in Ilzin Mykx.\n\nSome surprises happened, like a group of drug dealers had made it to the city and had begun selling one of their new inventions, a new and upcoming drug, to the crowd, which they called 'Demon's Blood'. It makes one unable to feel pain, and it enhances emotions such as joy, anger, and lust. If enough is snorted, it can even bring one closer to the realm of the demons and allow one to communicate with them. Despite being in an experimental phase, some users died taking it, one combusted in Green Flames and died proclaiming the names of Demons. Even [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] seems to have tried it, and far from sparingly. The crowd watched the Kult throw hundreds upon hundreds of slaves onto the pyre. They were surprised by how well treated and well fed the sacrificed were. Of course, they were also taken into account for the party; they would die in agonizing pain, sure. Still, they would taste the highest delicacies of the planet before death. As the commemorations were happening, the crowd started to get increasingly agitated; it was as if the city-wide party and the sacrificial pyre were bounding together, feeding each other. At this moment, a thought appeared on [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap], probably coming from Demon Blood, maybe from the Pyre and the Party, why not expand? Why not bring Hellfire to the entire world? Why just be a pirate when one can be the Xhazobine? To cover the whole globe on an endless orgy of violence, drugs, demons, hellfire, and raiding? Till the laughter of the Demons was heard on all realms, till all the blood was spilled, till nothing was left."

It is now up to the state to decide which proposed plans will be enacted. They all make sense; we can still use the criminal forced labor to enrich our lands, we can just maroon them, a classic sea punishment that would scare potential criminals and ties more to our sea heritage, or we can embrace the Cannorian model, of lashes for not-so-bad crimes and execution for capital punishment.

Not only have production costs been slashed, but the scientists have also been able to replace certain ingredients with more viable substitutes. No more crushed glass or goat blood, we are not using potato peels and chicken liver. What's more, they have developed several variants of the drug, with different purposes:\n\nA variant intended for the military, which induces rage but diminishes sensations such as pain. The problem is that in the long term, the individual loses all sensation of pain, but we have passed a veteran care for a reason, and the life expenctancy of our soldiers is not that high anyway.\n\nA variant intended for the clergy, which does very little to enhance your sense of pleasure, the dosage and ingredients instead aim to induce very heavy demonic hallucinations and open up one's body to demonic powers. This one should be used in a controlled space, as tests show that the user can randomly be possessed and go on a rampage. The Kult said they are used to this and see no problems with those side effects.\n\nThis variant is intended for the refined tastes and is milder than the usual recipe, but much safer. It allows for increased pleasure and can bring forth mild demonic hallucinations. It’s costly to produce, so it should be treated as a premium product.\n\nNow comes the necessary innovation, the variant intended for external export is cheaper than all the other variations and more dangerous than the others, it makes one energetic. It stimulates feelings of joy and pleasure, and it also brings forth severe demonic hallucinations. It’s highly addictive and is definitely going to be made illegal by foreign powers once they discover that using them can lead to demonic visions, hallucinations, possession, and even summonings, if the user is attuned to magic. We have one for internal use that is a bit safer and of higher quality; we don’t want our citizens to use the bad stuff, right? "

 mykx.22.d:0 "On organizing an expedition to a Precursor Temple, you expect the unexpected and trust the slaves more than your other expeditionaries. I once got a Haramari Priest, renowned for his piety, who tried to stab me in the back due to the relics we found, power, and gold can go to anyone's heads. So I promised the Krah coming with us, that they would be freed and some gold if they ensured that none of my companions would try to stab me in the back.From the outside of the temple, a circular array of towers dominated the landscape, with not even a single vine having grown on them as we approached the base of the towers, a floor made of solid white stone, not a single mark or signal of decay on it. I threatened to shoot my other Gnoll companions who wanted to stop to scrap the gilded doors leading inside the towers. I told them that we would have time for that later and that bigger bounties would be inside, also, selling the doors whole would be more profitable than scrapping the precursor metal from them. While said doors were easy enough to move, most of the doors inside have proven too thick to break through with our current equipment, resulting in our exploration teams coming to dead ends after dead ends, which is normal for a first expedition. We are here to get the lay of the land and get a feel of the place.\n\nEventually, we found a hallway with open doors, leading us to a large room where we recovered various precursor relics. It was at this moment that the attempted betrayal happened. While I was kneeling to check a relic, one of my companions tried to cut my throat. Unfortunately for him, I had secretly armed the slaves for that, so instead of my blood spilling in the temple, it was his brain mass that it did. A quick battle happened, and most of the expedition that planned my death, and that bitch Iehn Woenails, who cheated at cards yesterday, and I made sure to shoot her in the belly so she bled to death, was lying dead.\n\nWe could not progress further as exploitation requires specialized crew equipment and specialists. Due to the nature of Precursor Relics, I recommend a combination of Magic professionals and scientists, but that is for future expeditions. For this one, we have gathered a good number of relics and mapped the passages of the temple we can access. What should we do with the relics we found?"

Still their Bone Citadel is nonetheless impressive and worthy of restoration, not for Cheshosh, the imaginative god of death and ruin, but for the tangible demons that will see this place of death and decay as a piece of their own world, on Halann.

The tangible benefit soon appeared of the local harvest tripling in size, the hunts they did in the jungle always returning full, and the fishers returning with their boats almost sinking by the size of their catches.

The ashes of thousands of sacrifices painted the sky grey, and it sipped on the ocean, painting the land around in a black, ash-like tinge.

The Buccaneers wish for enrolment into the academy to be free of charge; they say that the academy should be based on a meritocratic system, and all should be able to join and climb as high as their talents carry them. The Smugglers wish to open up internship positions aboard their ships to students. They claim that the only way to gain experience and learning is through action and practice, so the students must be taught on real boats. The Xhazobkultists have the most unorthodox approach for the Naval Academy; they argue that the way to move ahead is to rely on the Xhaz. For that, they want religious training and specialization for the students and a refitting of the ships to accommodate that. This would mean that each vessel would be fitted with a special pyre and always be available for sacrifices, so the recently Kult trained Captain could make quick sacrifices and gain blessings that would fit the situation.\n\nTo ensure their interests are represented, all four factions have presented a candidate to become the principal of the Academy.

Still, she did not instill fear in those loyal to her and those who submitted, but to them she was caring, thoughtful, and always ready to listen. She knew the names of those she sailed with, from the lowest slave cleaning the lower decks to the spotter at the top.\n\nShe also had the same attitude about the republic's future; she refused to become a monarchy like the one in Viakkoc despite having all the capacity for it. She believed that the only way forward for our people was a system like the one she devised and helped to build.\n\nCountless captains visited her open casket to pay their respects; even her rivals or enemies went to pay their respects. It is commonplace that when a pirate captain dies, the remaining captains who remember them fondly will leave something of value in their casket to help pay for a proper funeral. This has been happening for centuries, even before the time of Mykx, back in Viakkoc. The casket of Mykx, however, had gotten so full of treasure that her face was almost covered. A secondary coffin had to be placed next to her; that one also got full, so we put a third one, and soon it will also be full.

Like, were we just put here to follow orders, and wait for the day that we become Xhazobine? Is it all just a big coincidence that we’re here together, on this boat? Or is there a greater purpose to all of this, some greater being who’s watching us with a plan, guiding our every step?

A census of their recent loot has revealed that they have only attacked Asraport coasts in the last 5 years, avoiding the Trollsbay entirely. The quantity of Dwarven slaves taken and near total absence of elves, humans, and halflings has raised some uncomfortable questions about ‘preferential slaving’ - which is a serious threat and insult to our equal-opportunity brand that we of course can not afford. \n\nWe immediately called them back to the mainland to answer for this discrepancy.

 mykx.42.d:0 "Another slow day on the patrol ship. You walk up to your best friend and fellow seaman, Tsagon Wethide, drawing something on a piece of parchment. Looking over his shoulder, you see him drawing… a parrot standing on a sword? As you look up, you see a somewhat familiar ship, but flying an unfamiliar flag - two crossed drumsticks. You shake Tsagon’s shoulder - “Tsagon! We should inform the captain! Potential enemy ship to starboard!” \n\nHe lazily looks up then scrunches up his snout in confusion, his brown eyes narrowing, “Did you not get the memo?” \n\n“We have memos?” You don’t remember there being memos. \n\nTsagon goes back to his drawing, “All our ships are to fly new flags, to confuse other navies. It’s a crew competition, too. I guess too many people were ripping out the throats of important members of the crew in bloodlust at sea, so the brass wanted to try a peaceful way to decide who should get the largest shares.” He hands you a piece of parchment."

 mykx.43.d:0 "It is well known to all that ships passing through the Ruined Triangle disappear under mysterious circumstances. Of course, to the gnolls of Mykx, the circumstances are far less mysterious, given that the cargo of said lost ships almost always ends up in their coffers. But one intrepid member of the council has brought forth a very unique idea to continue to expand our wealth. Given that no one can prove that we are attacking their ships, what if we instead loaned our services out as protection, for an exorbitant fee of course. Naturally, any ships that we are escorting wouldn’t be attacked, and we could build a lovely reputation as all those who don’t take up our ‘generous’ offer see the errors of their ways from the wrong side of a capsized hull."

 mykx.44.d:0 "Another slow day on the patrol ship. You and the rest of the seamen, including your best friend, Tsagon Wethide, have decided to make the most of the day and have a balancing competition. Tsagon is the reigning champion, but has confided to you in secret that he believes his balance to be off for the past few months, and he is not sure why. The contest, as usual, is conducted both with the participants in their normal state, and with them blindfolded. \n\nAs you judge the first segment, Tsagon, as usual, demolishes the competition, his brown eyes narrowed as he balances adroitly on the beam. You cheer and clap him on the back, and everyone gets ready for the blindfolded segment. \n\nTsagon immediately falls. You rush over to him as the rest of the participants take their turn, and as tears well up in his eyes, “I just don’t understand it. I’m fine with my eyes open. But the moment I close them, I can’t balance at all!” \n\nHe also describes feeling more tired than usual lately, having some weakness and loss of sensation in his arms and legs, and feeling tingling in his lower paws. He also says that for some reason he’s been way jumpy and his reflexes have been super fast, especially in his lower legs. You try to think about what could possibly be causing this or how to potentially treat it as the ships surgeon comes rushing over."

Genital lesions, a rash, and also…” and he shines a light in Tsagon’s eyes, both of which constrict. “Argyll-Robertson pupils. Accommodate to near objects but not to light." \n\nYou are confused. He continues talking. \n\n“This cluster of symptoms is actually a problem with something needed for the blood. One of the tests you can do,” as he pulls out a microscope and pricks Tsagon’s skin, “Is to look at the blood under this, and you see large blood cells and multilobed inflammatory cells.” \n\nYou are still confused. But you understand that your initial thought was wrong."
 mykx.47.d2:0 "The ship’s surgeon rushes over as you speak, shaking his head, “No, no.” He takes out his medical kit, “Good thought, but if there was a problem inside his head,” he says while he knocks on Tsagon’s skull, who protests loudly, “He would have trouble balancing with his eyes open as well, and he would have less reflexia, not more.” He takes a moment. “Also, he’d probably not be alive.” \n\nYou are confused. He continues talking. \n\n“This cluster of symptoms is actually a problem with something needed for the blood.

But what happens after some particular bacterial illnesses is an ascending paralysis. He wouldn’t be able to walk at all, starting with loss of movement with his feet, and his balance and sense of feeling would be fine. In fact, eventually he wouldn’t even be able to breathe!” Tsagon’s brown eyes widen in terror as the ship’s surgeon claps him on the back. “Don’t worry lad, that’s not what you have.” \n\nYou are confused. He continues talking. \n\n“This cluster of symptoms is actually a problem with something needed for the blood.

 mykx.45.t:0 "The Captive Market"
 mykx.45.d:0 "While many of our riches come from ‘liberated’ goods aboard wayward vessels in the Ruined Sea, there are subtler ways to line our coffers. One way that we have become rather infamous for is our sale of hallucinogens and opioids, generally banned across Halann. However, contacts within our markets in Western Cannor have been looking at something unique, which is a rather new venture for us. \n\nThe noble ‘Winelords’ of Lorent often sneer at our attempts to create Aelentiri vintage, but we can spice up our current supply by combining our other expertise, infusing our wine with subtle narcotics. The result, tested on captives caught from our raids, is a rather insidious and addictive drink. A pleasant lethargy, a calming of the nerves at first - but soon, the cravings become lasting. Yes, on first sip, they’ll scoff at the taste, but soon they’ll pay any price to keep the bottles coming. \n\nTraditionalists and naval officers within our government, however, turn their snouts up at the idea - stating that if the Winelords want to look down on us, let them. We will torch their ports, sink their merchant fleets, and then they’ll have little use for their ‘superior’ vintage other than to drown their sorrows with."

 mykx.46.t:0 "The Howling of the Hunt"
 mykx.46.d:0 "An exciting day on the patrol ship! Howls fill the air as the crew rushes to gather blades and weapons and man battle stations. You lock eyes with Tsagon Wethide, your best friend, his brown eyes filled with determination as he tosses you your blade. You catch it and turn to the merchant ship that has unknowingly entered dangerous waters. You don’t quite know what the flag is - vexillology was never your strength - but it doesn’t really matter. It isn’t Mykx, and thus is free food. As the ship turns hard to starboard, everyone’s feet are steady on the deck, trained by many years at sea. You can see activity beginning on the other ship as they notice your approach, and your ear twitches as you hear shouts begin to arise. \n\nAn arrow whizzes over your shoulder and lands into the wood of the deck, near the boxes filled with cannon ammo. You crouch down into a battle stance as the ship gets within boarding range, and your eyes drift to the ropes and hooks necessary to begin pulling the ship closer. As you do, you hear a cry for help come from the stern, near the quarterdeck. As a gnoll, the concept of ‘command’ is more of a suggestion, as those who fight the best in raids get the lion's share of the loot, leading to a taste for individuality in moments like these rather than following the orders of your captain. You think of the myriad of options ahead of you, knowing that Tsagon will follow your lead."
 mykx.46.a:0 "Grab the grappling hooks and toss - it’s time to board!"

 mykx.48.t:0 "Blood On The Deck"
 mykx.48.d:0 "You grab the grappling hooks and toss them towards the mast of the other ship - as they latch, you and Tsagon swing over and land on the deck, quickly dispatching two terrified humans with practiced strikes. Leading the charge, you howl as you continue plowing through the enemies topdeck - the fighting is brutal and chaotic, a whirlwind of steel and fury, fangs and gunpowder. As a man with a feathered cap lunges at you, Tsagon parries his blade just in time and you kick the unbalanced human overboard, sharing a wink with your friend. The air is thick with the smell of blood, and as you sniff, you notice the unmistakable insignia and luxury of a captain’s clothes from across the deck. You begin to rush that way, knowing that will gain you the most loot. But as you do, you hear a cry from behind you - turning, you see Tsagon cornered by two burly sailors with clubs as he tries to follow you."
 mykx.48.a:0 "Help Tsagon. No one hurts my friend!"
 mykx.48.b:0 "He can handle himself. Go for the riches!"

 mykx.49.t:0 "Comrades In Arms"
 mykx.49.d:0 "You snarl as you turn away from the ship’s captain - and the loot - and make your way back to your friend. As he dodges a swipe from one club, crashing into the deck and splintering the wood, you grab the hand of the other man rearing up for an overhand swing from behind. He grunts in surprise as you kick into the back of his knees, causing him to crumple to the ground, and Tsagon slits his throat. You grab the club from the now-lifeless body and swing it into the other, still recovering from his whiffed strike. You hear a distinct crack as several ribs shatter, and as he keels over, trickling red from his mouth, you know he’s out of the fight. You and Tsagon share a brief nod, and turn to see the captain of this mercantile vessel being brought down by your first mate. The sounds of battle cease as the haze of the sea mist and gunpowder obfuscates the scene of the crime, and the howls of the victorious Mykx pirates are joined by you and Tsagon as you begin to go belowdecks and grab everything you can carry."
 mykx.49.a:0 "Another successful boarding operation!"

 mykx.50.t:0 "Fight The Captain"
 mykx.50.d:0 "You snarl as you continue your course. Tsagon is a capable fighter, he’ll be alright. As you carve a path through, you see your first mate also on a beeline for the mercantile ship’s captain, and your pupils dilate and your breathing quickens even more as primitive instincts take over - the hunt is on. You leap over a swung sword and break another man’s hand as he tries to level a firearm at you, sliding underneath a piece of the mast broken from an errant cannonball as you reach the captain first - your first mate having been waylaid by a woman with the glint of magic at her fingertips. You strike first, but he expertly parries with a dagger before attempting to return the favor - gashing across your shoulder. You suppress a whimper as you grab his arm and bring him closer in, biting down and tasting blood. He cries out, and your blade finds its mark between his ribs in the moment of surprise. The humans for some reason always expect you to fight fair. As his limp body falls, a quiet hush falls over the ship, and the sounds of battle cease, though the haze of sea mist and gunpowder remain. The howls of the victorious Mykx pirates begin, and fortunately you hear Tsagon’s voice within. You join, quickly pilfering through the captain’s pockets and then joining the rest of your crew belowdecks to grab everything you can carry."
 mykx.50.a:0 "Another successful boarding operation!"

 mykx.51.t:0 "A Thunderous Reply"
 mykx.51.d:0 "You nod to the cannons and Tsagon, from years of working together, implicitly understands what you mean. You race to the nearest cannon as Tsagon behind you grabs several crates worth of ammo and heaves them over to you. The work is hot and heavy as you pack the chamber, ramming powder and shot as the ship rocks from the waves, arrows and bullets careen past, and the shouts from those who decided to board carry over the water. Your grey fur is slick - whether from water, sweat, or the blood of the crewman who had fallen next to him, you have no idea. The enemy attempts to maneuver away but they’re still easily in range. The only question now is whether to pack with grapeshot and fire across the deck to inflict casualties, or to fire a solid hit straight at their mast and cripple them so they have nowhere to go."
 mykx.51.a:0 "Hit the deck - any survivors will be too demoralized to fight."
 mykx.51.b:0 "Hit the mast - we can't loot the ship if it runs away from us."

 mykx.52.t:0 "Scatterblast"
 mykx.52.d:0 "You dodge another arrow as you pack in the grapeshot, light the fuse and duck behind the ship's railing with Tsagon, flashing him a toothy grin. After about 3 seconds… BOOM! The cannon bucks as it fires the payload, and you look over to see that it has decimated the forces on the deck preparing to fight the oncoming gnolls, though some of the more frenzied feet-first into action types got hit in the blast too. The first mate nods at you as he grabs a grappling hook and swings onto the ship, heading straight for the mercantile ship’s captain, yelling orders from the quarterdeck. Quickly, the remaining sailors surrender, and the victorious howls of the Mykx crew reverberate throughout the night, yours and Tsagon’s joining them. While you won’t gain the vast majority of the loot not being on the boat itself, the first mate does give you more than a fair share considering your contribution to the battle."
 mykx.52.a:0 "A well-fired shot."

 mykx.53.t:0 "Calculated Shot"
 mykx.53.d:0 "You whistle gleefully as you pack in the cannonball, swing the cannon towards the mast, and light the fuse, one eye closed as you aim and make the requisite calculations in your head to ensure that your fire strikes true. You may not have done well at vexillology - but you were always a whiz at kinematics and mechanics. Tsagon bats away an arrow with his shield, and you both hunker down behind the railing as… BOOM! The cannon bucks and fires, and you hear the unmistakable splintering of wood, and then a second crash as said wood smashes down onto the deck of the mercantile ship, crushing a strangely well-dressed human woman underneath it. With the hooks in and the mast down, the other ship quickly comes to a stop, and as the first mate gives you a clap on the back, the surviving sailors on the other ship throw their weapons to the ground and surrender. The victorious howls of your crew bounce off of the waves, and you and Tsagon gleefully join them. While you won’t gain the vast majority of the loot not being on the boat itself, the first mate does give you more than a fair share considering your contribution to the battle."
 mykx.53.a:0 "A well-fired shot."

 mykx.54.t:0 "Man The Helm"
 mykx.54.d:0 "Your ears twitch as you hear the familiar sound of your navigator cry out in pain. You grab Tsagon’s shoulder as he goes for the grappling hooks and point in that direction. His brown eyes squint, and then widen, before he looks back at you, having seen the same thing you did - the navigator has gone down, and everyone is too busy trying to gain their share of the loot to notice. \n\n“Someone’s got to man the helm.” You nod, and begin to rush that way. Climbing up the stairs on all fours, you reach the wheel, and see the navigator, his bronze fur matted with blood around his shoulder from a gunshot wound. \n\nHe coughs, red sputum splattering across the deck, and points ahead, weakly sputtering ‘The reefs… They’re trying to lead us into The Dragon’s Teeth.” You look and see the plan - their narrower boat could more easily fit into the treacherous, narrow channel through the rocks, and potentially trap your own ship, unless well maneuvered. \n\nYou look at Tsagon. He’s been practicing at the helm lately, and he knows exactly what you're thinking. But his usual look of easy confidence is gone, and he’s terrified. You grip his shoulder; “You got this. I’ll cover you.” He takes a deep breath, and nods, grabbing the helm as you pull up a shield nearby to protect him from any retaliation. But when you check back in, he’s looking back at you. You know exactly what he’s thinking - do we try to avoid the reefs entirely? Or try to outsail them inside?"
 mykx.54.a:0 "We’ll out-sail them in the reefs. Their plan will be their doom!"
 mykx.54.b:0 "Push to port and broadside them to avoid the reefs entirely!"

 mykx.55.t:0 "The Dragon's Teeth"
 mykx.55.d:0 "Tsagon sets his jaw, and takes a quick breath, lifting his shoulders up and down in a practiced motion as he spins the wheel, following the mercantile ship's path towards the narrow channel. You narrow your eyes as you see a human woman reach up from the side of the ship and point at you with her finger - and then out comes a bolt of fire! You quickly block it with the steel shield, before dropping it as the heat radiating through it becomes too much to hold. When you look back, the woman has been struck down by your first mate, who gives you and Tsagon a hearty nod, before turning to a burly man with a club. \n\nYou look again to the bow, and see that you have entered the channel, with Tsagon expertly guiding the ship through the foaming spray and jagged rocks. The other vessel, expecting an easy escape, begins to lag as more hooks fly out, and as their wheel is turned frantically, a sickening crunch is heard as they run aground. They have nowhere to go. Your crew begins to howl in victory as the remaining living sailors throw down their weapons and surrender. And you embrace Tsagon in a massive hug, before breaking off and joining the howls."
 mykx.55.a:0 "Unbelievable finesse at the helm!"

 mykx.56.t:0 "Pinning"
 mykx.56.d:0 "The insane gamble is not worth the cost. Tsagon quickly turns the wheel and turns the ship to port and a little ahead of the mercantile vessel and begins pressing the ships hulls together, allowing even more hungry gnolls to jump on board. As the creak of wood against wood is heard, you lift your shield up and block three arrows coming at Tsagon’s head. He gives you an appreciative smile, which you return before turning your eyes back on the other deck, now filled with a haze of smoke, gunpowder, and sea-mist. The larger size of your vessel as well as Tsagon’s expert steering allows you to easily push out the mercantile vessel away from The Dragon’s Teeth - and as the mass of gnolls frenzies on the deck, the captain manning the wheel calls for a surrender, knowing his gambit has failed. Head down, he throws down his weapon, and his crew follows in turn, as the howls of the victorious gnolls drowns out the sound of the breaking wood. You and Tsagon join in the celebration, and the captain of your vessel gives you a solemn nod, understanding the sacrifice you two made to take up your position instead of rushing for the loot on the boat."

 mykx.57.d:0 "The first writing of the Mykx constitution was a mess, because everyone involved, except Mykx herself, thought it was an excuse she made to gather all her enemies and kill them. The pirates laughed at the idea of writing a document to detail the obvious; everyone knew Mykx was in power, and she sure would crown herself as a Queen or something. So the first writing consisted of Mykx chasing around her newfound republic, capturing the most powerful, and bringing all of them to the congregation.\n\nWhen it started, the assembly didn’t have paper to write because the servants and slaves were expecting the meeting to be a massacre, not an actual debate session with writing involved. Also, every proposal, the assembly looked at Mykx as expecting her to proclaim if she liked or not; her answer was always, I respect all the decisions made by the republic.\n\nSo that was how the first laws and proposals were signed; that is why it’s possible to see on the constitution itself, on the margins, help messages or the writing of improvised wills, nobody expected to leave that meeting alive."
