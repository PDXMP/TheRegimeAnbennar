 B43_home_of_the_stray_title: "Home of the Stray"
 B43_home_of_the_stray_desc: "Zezzuk has been getting real melancholy lately. Just sits down on the bench near the fountain and looks at all the goblins with their dogs passing by. The ostentatious sighs do not help, and some folks have expressed the desire for us to “do something about him” or “at least move the bench further away”.\n\nTurns out, the gobbo is just homesick. His previous infatuation with horses is completely gone, and now he misses charging people head on with spiders. Not much we can do, sadly, aside from trying to make this place feel a little more like home."

 B43_and_the_prideful_ones_title: "And the Prideful Ones"
 B43_and_the_prideful_ones_desc: "So there’s good news and bad news.\n\nGood news is: Zezzuk is no longer bothering people with his conspicuous homesickness.\n\nBad news is: He is really into this whole knight thing now. He connected the dots and realized that we ride dogs like the heroes of old rode horses. Now he goes around everywhere fully armored, sword in hand, saying things like “Pray tell me, whenceforth shall we departeth, for I hold a cornucopia of trepidation concerning the forthcoming quest.”\n\nAnd he isn’t the only one. The demand for swords and castles is higher than it’s ever been. At least it’s not horses. Or dragons."

 B43_ruins_of_history_title: "Ruins of History"
 B43_ruins_of_history_desc: "I hear Taranton is lovely this time of year! But do you know when it was the loveliest? When it served as the capital of Adenica. The birthplace of knights, gallantry, and the chivalrous state! Shamefully, our prior ways of rob ‘n’ ransack left little of the city standing, but we have learned much about its now deceased inhabitants. Let us use that knowledge to rebuild and restore, and if anything bad happens on the way there we can just blame it on the Munchers."

 B43_knightsmarch_title: "Knightsmarch"
 B43_knightsmarch_desc: "The loveliness of Devaced was just to earn our wage\nThe glory that was Castonath is of another age\nWe've been terribly alone and enslaved inside the mountains\nWe’ll make our home in the west - that’s our stage\nOh we left our hearts in Taranton\nFlat on the plains, it calls to us\nTo be where little puppy bounds are trained to leaping hounds."

 B43_warm_walls_title: "Warm Walls"
 B43_warm_walls_desc: "An old city, standing tall and proud. Dostanorian. What’s that? It’s, uh, the kind of human that used to live here.\n\nA newly established goblin clan, ambition overflowing. Yes, that’s us.\n\nSome no-name orc raiders that nobody cares about. Shuh, of course they had names but nobody cares, that’s why I said it like that. Point is:\n\nEvery goblin clan needs a goblin home, and we have to start goblin' up territory somewhere."

 B43_booming_clan_title: "Booming Clan"
 B43_booming_clan_desc: "Devaced - home. At least it was before the adventurers screwed everything up.\n\nNot our home of course, but the Dostonorians. The whole area is in ruins, really. Farmlands left to rot, fortresses burned to the ground, once bustling markets now completely devoid of life. Desolation as far as the eye can see. But you know what that means: it’s all ripe for the taking. This is our turf now, we will make our beds and sleep in them. The clan is on the up and up, and the adventurers down and down, preferably six feet under."

 B43_pride_of_escann_title: "Pride of Escann"
 B43_pride_of_escann_desc: "So the most important thing to know is that we’re talking about Vernham. Not OLD Vernham, NEW Vernham, otherwise known as just Vernham, or simply Vernham in some circles. Got that? Not the one with the swordsmiths, the one with the swordmasters. Well, they’re all dead now anyhow, but we’re going to change that. No, not via necromancy, we’re going to remake the whole thing. No, we’re not going to turn into humans, you dense louse - get to work, would you?"

 B43_seeking_the_glimmer_title: "Seeking the Glimmer"
 B43_seeking_the_glimmer_desc: "Humans used to live here. But not anymore. Suckers, hah!\n\nThere is this one thing though, it sort of keeps me up at night. Fortunately, after a full day of raiding you always sleep like a baby.\n\nYou see this imagery a lot around these parts: castles, swords, horses and dragons. If you had to pick two out of four there, it’s gotta be horses and swords, right? You can’t fight with a castle and mounting a dragon sounds scary as the pits. Horses and swords though, there’s something about them…"

 B43_the_call_of_duty_title: "The Call of Duty"
 B43_the_call_of_duty_desc: "Really, it was love at first sight. I didn’t know that at the time, because how could I? You can’t ever know that, I don’t think. But things like that, you feel them deep within; they take root inside you and grow over time, until the sprouts begin showing on the surface for all to see. Even the strongest necromantic spell can’t get rid of it.\n\nAnd when we actually got someone to read that damn book out loud? Oh man, then I knew for sure. I told you, didn’t I? Horses and swords. Turns out, there’s a better word for that: Knights."

 B43_united_in_battle_title: "United in Battle"
 B43_united_in_battle_desc: "It is done.\n\nThe clanbosses of Grasshopper Muncher and Earworm have both seen the book now. Truly, no one can resist the knightly call of duty. We are ready to move out at a moment’s notice, together, as we stand tall and proud. Well, as we sit. On the dogs. The other clans also like the dogs. So ready up, Escann - the knights are back in town."

 B43_break_the_cleaver_title: "Break the Cleaver"
 B43_break_the_cleaver_desc: "Ugol Rotcleaver. We spit on the name. Far too long has he and his clan threatened us and our Muncher comrades. The sheer indignity we endure by sharing this land with an orc like him is too much. He would tell you that his people are fighting evil necromancers, that they learn from the knights of old, that they seek reconciliation. Do not believe him! Just don’t! The despoilers of Adenica will fall by our hand!"

 B43_taste_of_honor_title: "Taste of Honor"
 B43_taste_of_honor_desc: "That was a good duel. I liked it when we both took a step backwards, huffed for a while, gave each other knowing nods, and simultaneously lunged forward one last time. I felt it in my gut, this was it. No going back, the fate of the clan resting on my shoulders, the future of my people contained within my blade. Ah, that moment is what it is all about. Life culminates here. Mine, yours, everyone’s. And for a split second, you see it - an opening. You think about it, you think real hard about it and you decide - no. This is not what you do. You are a knight. We all are.\n\nChivalry won that day. I lost. I am satisfied though. You don’t hit below the belt."

 B43_break_the_deadfangs_title: "Break the Deadfangs"
 B43_break_the_deadfangs_desc: "The good people of Escann have suffered long enough! It is up to us to save them, now that the knightly covenant is official, from the abhorrent practices of the Deadfang clan. Indeed, even before the Greentide these loathsome scoundrels have relied upon a practice most vile to further their influence - necromancy. For as long as we stand, it cannot and will not stand! The only thing being brought back to life in dubious form and made to conform to their masters’ twisted wishes here is good old gallant chivalry!"

 B43_consolidate_the_south_title: "Consolidate the South"
 B43_consolidate_the_south_desc: "“When a tribe sees the fire of conquest stir in their guts, it is already halfway to becoming a nation.”\n\nKorgus Dookanson said that. And I’d say he knows a little bit more about conquest than you do, pal, because he invented it. But then he went and died, good riddance, and all of Escann breathed a sigh of relief. Aside from all the dead Escannis who aren’t breathing any more that is, but what’s done is done. In any case, we claimed this land as our home, felt that fire in our guts, and our home it has become. A home, nay, THE home of the knights."

 B43_union_of_the_strong_title: "Union of the Strong"
 B43_union_of_the_strong_desc: "We are goblins. You are humans. It’s sad, but nobody’s perfect.\n\nNevertheless! It is the chivalric way to strive for perfection no matter your limits. Break through them if you must! Your swords are the swords that will pierce the heavens!\n\nSo welcome, one and all, the human and the goblin, the weak and the strong, to a new age. Our clan is one for all, and we are all for one. We protect yours and you protect ours, and the tales will be told not of us or of you - but of all the Flying Hounds!"

 B43_a_crusade_of_our_own_title: "A Crusade of our Own"
 B43_a_crusade_of_our_own_desc: "To protect the meek, evil must be squashed!\nWhat is evil, you ask? Well, many things can be considered evil. Kicking a baby down the stairs, for example. Unless that baby was the avatar of a disgraced god of war or something, then maybe…\n\nBut no matter, because something is close to us that’s always been ontologically evil. Even if it feeds hungry war orphans. Or helps the elderly. Or saves damsels. But that’s all hypothetical, I assure you, in reality it does none of that.\n\nSo bring out the stakes! Vanish the vampires! Become crusaders!"

 B43_knights_of_the_garden_title: "Knights of the Garden"
 B43_knights_of_the_garden_desc: "Well we’ve had our ups and we’ve had our downs\nWe’ve had our smiles and we’ve had our frowns\nBut we still say we should be crowned\nThe Knights of the Garden\n\nWhat more can a poor gob do\nQuesting for the likes of all of you\nWhat more can a poor gob say\nBut we will give our help in any way!"

 B43_allies_in_the_dark_title: "Allies in the Dark"
 B43_allies_in_the_dark_desc: "In a perfect world, goblins like Gramzik would not exist.\n\nNor orcs like Korgus. Nor adventurers like… any of them actually, they’re all better off dead.\n\nBut this is not a perfect world. We’re all goblins here, and let’s face it, we need all the help we can get. Pagfil and his Earworm clan will be a good starting point. And in regards to Gramzik and his Munchers, well, when they think they stand alone? We shall be beside them."

 B43_a_helping_hand_title: "A Helping Hand"
 B43_a_helping_hand_desc: "Gramzik’s distrust of us, and of all other goblins for that matter, was tough to deal with. No matter what we tried, he wouldn’t listen (or read, but we still don’t know if he even can the thick fuck).\n\nTwo ways to go about it then. Either we show the Munchers that we can be trusted, or we show them that they can trust us. The Worms have already recognized that we can only survive together, it’s just a matter of bringing everyone to the same table.\n\nHm? What do you mean, “tautological”? How did you learn that word?"

 B43_de_feathering_title: "De-Feathering"
 B43_de_feathering_desc: "To the south, a band most deplorable laid their claim to the land. They profess to be protectors of the weak, bah! Spreading the “tenets” of some “riyla”, who would see goblins and orcs in her arms; we see them for what they are, vile adventurers who would pillage any and all land they find themselves in. Neither we, nor our Earworm compatriots can allow these monsters free reign anywhere near our homes.\n\nPlus, their name is stupid. Are you telling me that a raven marches their banner?"

 B43_glory_of_old_title: "Glory of Old"
 B43_glory_of_old_desc: "Caylen Longlance, the first knight, founder of the Sapphire Order.\nClarimonde of Oldhaven, the slayer of Nichmer.\nMaugun of Ording, the lowborn Unicorn Knight.\nSer Cadell, an orphan squired and knighted.\nUrion Starsworn, the first non-human knight.\nSer Devan the Righteous, the first paladin.\nAldresia, laid her life to slay Canrec the Defiler.\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], …"

 B43_claim_the_gleam_title: "Claim the Gleam"
 B43_claim_the_gleam_desc: "Bladeskeep. The keep of blades. The keep amongst keeps. Keeps inside of it a blade. The blade amongst blades.\n\nOr so we’re told, but for now, it’s all hearsay. We ought to fulfill our sacred duty and protect it, as its stewards. That’s what knights do after all. Plus, once we’re in, it’s one step closer to this… what was it? Kalyindal. That was it. The sword amongst swords."

 B43_stewardiest_stewards_title: "Stewardiest Stewards"
 B43_stewardiest_stewards_desc: "Bladeskeep is a storied place.\nFrom the Kingdom of the Blade, founded during the Dragonwake.\nThrough the 657 War of the Blade and the Bladechosen’s untimely death atop Trialmount and the loss of the Blade.\nTo Clarimonde of Oldhaven finding the Blade, slaying the sorcerer Nichmer with it, and refounding the Kingdom as Blademarches.\n\nAnd now, to us! Onto us, the Blade! The shiniest, gleamiest sword of all is in our hands and we are its stewards! And of the keep, too, of course. Never again shall it fall, for we, the best knights, will be the last knights of Bladeskeep!"

 B43_warrior_culture_title: "Warrior Culture"
 B43_warrior_culture_desc: "The plaintive speak, and we take notice.\nThe deeds are done, and grace received.\nLaments are cried, and farewells exchanged.\n\nThere are problems though, and they grow in number with each unanswered plea. Every justice undelivered and every quest unfulfilled is a stain on our honor. And those can never be washed clean, only patched up, with horribly mismatched rags. Put simply, we lack knights.\n\nHire the criers, reserve every street corner and all the gallows, we’re going to need everyone to hear this.\n\nEVERY GOBLIN, A MEMBER OF THE COVENANT."

 B43_children_of_escann_title: "Children of Escann"
 B43_children_of_escann_desc: "It is one thing to go out on a quest to a faraway land as an errant knight, and another to look an orphaned child in the eyes and take them in as your own. Both are chivalrous, both are gallant, both befit a cavalier, but only the latter is of any benefit to the clan. And is that not what we are still? Before the duelling and jousting, before the oaths and quests, we were but a few goblins banded together. In time though, this land took us in, and so shall we take in all the waifs and strays. Just like a family: build it right, take care of it, it'll live beyond you."

 B43_high_chivalric_culture_title: "High Chivalric Culture"
 B43_high_chivalric_culture_desc: "Flying Hound. The name was bestowed to us by Elgek, and we never really gave it much thought. Ride the dogs, they jump in the air, and so the hounds fly, and thus the name. But - there were always heights beyond our reach. The heights of chivalric Escann, of Urion Starsworn and of Caylen Longlance. Ones beyond our time. And so we’ve done the only thing that could have been done in this situation. We clawed our way through the tomes and tales of old, we learned and we grew as people, and the results speak for themselves.\n\nBoth the hound and the knight now fly higher than ever."


#Events
 flavour_flying_hound.1.t: "The Feral Cry of Freedom"
 flavour_flying_hound.1.d: "Out on the desolate roads of Godsescker sits a tavern that has been left to ruin. But life stirs around this run-down shack. A host of dog riders has gathered here eagerly awaiting the opportunity to join what they believe is a bright path forward. Bursting forth from the tavern door, a goblin clad in leather armor embroidered with a winged dog on its back, accompanied by an entourage of goblins wearing similar leathers. The crowd cheers in a series of howls as Elgek, the new clanboss of the Flying Hound clan stands before them. He looks upon all those who have rallied to his cause and shouts, \n\n“HOUNDS!!!” The crowd grows silent. “Korgus is dead…” The crowd erupts into celebratory cheers but Elgek quickly shushes that. \n\n“...and nothing has changed,” Elgek pauses before continuing. “We are free just as we have always been since the day we stepped foot outside those damned mountains!” \n\n“You see, in those caves we were caged in. Cramped halls always leave you backed in a corner, easy prey to those who would see us in chains.”  \n\n“But here? There's more than enough space! It's so open no one could possibly catch us! Not a horse, warg or spider could match the speeds of our dogs!” \n\n“And that's the truth, we have been free for decades now! But only with Korgus’ death can we see that it was fear that held us back all those years! As long as we have had our rides, we have been free in this land!” \n\n“So Let’s finally show these orcs that we are not slaves! Let’s show these adventurers that we belong in this land! And let's stop behaving like cowards and show that when you back a Flying Hound into a corner, you get bit!” \n\nCheers erupt as Elgek makes his way from the tavern entrance through the crowd, receiving slaps on the back from his fellow riders along the way, towards his ride. Hopping on, Elgek lets out a final rallying cry."
 flavour_flying_hound.1.a: "Come on you dogs! Let's ride!!"
 flavour_flying_hound.2.t: "Amongs the Ruins"
 flavour_flying_hound.2.d: "“...and we will go our own way. There’s enough crap here for everyone, but none of it is worth anyone’s lives, don’t you think?”\nThe orcs don’t seem to calm down, but their leader almost imperceptibly loosens the grip on his axe. Elgek puffs, arms still frozen in a non-threatening shrug. The peace is momentarily threatened with the chieftain’s arm rising, but the tension dissipates once he uses the axe to signal his band to follow him to a different area. Elgek breathes a sigh of relief that almost turns into a whistle.\n“Hounds! You have until the sun sets, grab what you want first and what you can second, then we move out.”\n\nHours pass. Elgek sits, back bent, on the fountain in the town square, watching his clan loot this Dostanorian has-been city. A tinge of regret in his thoughts is quickly painted over by the barking of his trusty ride. Someone is quickly running over to him.\n“Boss! Sorry, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! Look!” It’s Zezzuk, holding a… brick? No, thinner than one. What is that, actually?\n“I know ‘Grab What You Can’ is a tall order Zezzuk, but you don’t have to bring absolutely everything with you.”\n“But Boss… Sorry, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! There’s pictures in here, nice ‘uns.” He holds up the strange thing for Elgek to see. There sure are pictures in there. Nice ones.\n“Of course there’s pictures Zezzuk, this is called a book! Pictures are what's in books!”\n“Pretty horsie…” He doesn’t react and keeps pointing at individual drawings. Elgek relents and looks at the horsie. Pretty. “What does it say here, boss?”\n“Here? Uhh, let’s see…” He squints as hard as he can. Zezzuk holds his breath, but after a minute of silence, his lungs give out and he gasps for air. Elgek successfully defends against the pull of a smirk. “I will tell you later, now give it here.”\n\nIt’s not the horsie, but what’s on it that’s grabbed his attention. The armored rider looks majestic. Would look better on a spider though. Or a dog. Now, that would be-\n“Spectacular. We need to learn more about those. Maybe…”\nFind someone who can read it? Somewhere deep in Escann, he knows they're hiding. Will he ever know? Will always be a mystery…"
 flavour_flying_hound.2.a: "What does the book say?"
 flavour_flying_hound.3.t: "Visions of the Epic"
 flavour_flying_hound.3.d: "“There is nothing more reviled than the adventurer,” Elgek thought as he looked over [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]. He had not given the orders to loot, and yet the Hounds were already on it, plundering whatever they could get their hands on. Fatherly pride filled his heart and a pet-demanding head nuzzled his hand. He obliged with a small smile and big hug.\n\n“Oi, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! Come over ‘ere a while!” Zozzok’s voice rang out from behind him, grating as ever; somehow, hearing his new title only made it worse. Elgek turned his head around, his mount following suit.\n“What is the meaning of this, Zozzok? I’ve no need for plunder of that kind.”\n“Oh, I know, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sir, but she seemed very calm when we came and then attacked us and so we attacked her and then she fainted and…”\n“Blyjab, Zozzok, get to the point.”\n“Well, the crest there on the sleeve, your [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] majesty, does it not look like the one you-” Elgek cut him off with a wave and promptly got closer. Indeed, that was exactly what he’d been looking for. His mind flashed with possibilities, but ultimately he couldn’t be sure. Only one way to find out.\n\nHe insisted on not calling it an interrogation. The captive noblewoman would vehemently disagree, but in the end she told him everything he wanted. Of their home’s history and the questing nights. How they lived under kingdomes, and how they took pride in adjusting tournaments.\n“A life worth living.” Came out his mouth. “I’d be so good at dueling.” Ran through his head.\n\nThe door opened, and the rest of the clan stared with wide eyes at their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] bowing his head and letting the woman go. All of their gazes followed the surprisingly alive and well captive, until Elgek cleared his throat and spoke:\n“Gentlegoblins! Today, we have found a new foe to vanquish. A foe most threatening, most formidable, and most elusive.” The goblins collectively gasped.\n“Who’s the foe, boss, sorry, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?”\nElgek straightened his back, looked up to the sky, and proclaimed:"
 flavour_flying_hound.3.a: "The past."
 flavour_flying_hound.4.t: "Tales, Pretty Little Things"
 flavour_flying_hound.4.d: "“All in all, the funds have been aptly distributed between the province and the order headquarters, and all the complaints about embezzlement should be treated as the unfounded rumors that they are. That is all.” The Muncher [B46.Monarch.GetTitle] placed his right hand on his chest and bowed just enough to not be considered uncourteous.\n“Now, if we can move on to the actually pressing matters…” The young goblin retainer behind him quickly grabbed the chair and slid it into a position where his boss could comfortably sit back down. The Hound [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was bereft of such a servant.\n\nGrimacing slightly, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] took this chance to scan the room [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was seated in, revealing the extent of changes that the Grasshopper Muncher clan had introduced to the castle, and indeed, Taranton at large. Shoddily renovated facade draped with banners of the three Prideful Bunch clans, interspersed with the occasional coat of arms of some long gone Adenner noble family. Even the chandelier above the table seemed to join in on the collective pretense of knighthood. Nevertheless, there was one aspect to it all, one which could possibly achieve a verisimilitude potent enough to leave a bystander stunned in awe:\n\nThe way they carried themselves. The poise, the mannerisms, how they kept their hands on their swords without gripping the hilt. The words they spoke, so pretentiously archaic and so needlessly complicated, but oh so captivating to the unsuspecting ear that only ever expected a monstrous holler to tintinnabulate. The names they called one another, befitting a most gallant court. Right, that’s what it was all about. [Root.Monarch.GetName] straightened [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] posture, placed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] elbows on the table, clasped [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands together and spoke thusly:"
 flavour_flying_hound.4.a: "‘Tis a wonder how much you’ve done, and you may reap the reward."
 flavour_flying_hound.4.b: "The past that we need overcome is ours and ours alone."
 flavour_flying_hound.4.c: "Find a suitable date to take the new oaths. And don’t forget to invite me."
 flavour_flying_hound.5.t: "STOP SCREAMING"
 flavour_flying_hound.5.d: "There was the shortest possible moment before the orcs started mouthing off again.\n“I will rip your guts out!”, “These chains are temporary, our rightful rage is eternal!”, and “Your mother was a kobold!” were only the latest additions to the litany of doubtful debilitations they deposited upon their captors’ pride.\n“I will cut your damn tongues off, I swear to Apzarko Hrom…” It was a terrible lie. No harm would come to them before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s decision was publicly announced. Thus the column of chained Rotcleavers inched forward evermore, each one angrier and louder than the next. Only at the very back, where the most important figures were tossed up onto a couple of carts, some semblance of peace and quiet could be attained. That was, until…\n\n“I wish to speak to your leader, stuntie.” That one is meant for dwarves, what a moron.\n“We are headed back to Devaced so that you can do exactly that, greenskin.” Come on, just try to jab back.\n“No, I mean your leader here. We need to stop for a bit.” Nothing this time?\n“We are not stopping before Devaced, greenskin.” Maybe once more will do it.\n“The stop is absolutely imperative to the collective safety of this convoy.” Damn smartass, what’s that word mean again? But more importantly…\n“Why no insult this time, huh, greenskin? Too debased to act? Too slighted to taunt?”\n“Well, it’s a bit awkward isn’t it. I mean… we’re both green”\n“What, obviously not! I am of a hue most elegant and proud, the regal red!”\n“You look green enough to me…”\n“Impudence! We have bested you in battle! We are the victors, you are the losers! We, the conquerors, you, the conquered! We - the chivalric knights! You - the vile monsters!”\n“...stuntie.”\n\nThere was the shortest possible moment before-\n\n“I have HAD it with these mutablyjab orcs on these mutablyjab carts! Just you wait until [Root.Monarch.GetName] hears of this, I tell you, as my name is Zozzok, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will…"
 flavour_flying_hound.5.a: "...let you all live as usual. Fuck my fat goblin life."
 flavour_flying_hound.5.b: "...have you all skinned alive!"
 flavour_flying_hound.6.t: "The First Covenant"
 flavour_flying_hound.6.d: "“Put. That. Down.” The last word managed to just barely escape into the room through the Worm’s clenched teeth.\n“I…” the Muncher held the entire table hostage with momentary but crushing silence, before raising his arm and declaring: “...refuse!”\n“Gentlegoblins! I know the occasion is momentous and celebrations are in order, however, we should first properly put into writing the-” CLANG\n\n“CLANG CLANG CLANG” echoed the chandelier hanging above the table, as The Muncher struck it with the soon-to-be ceremonial sword. Right arm, strike, left leg, stomp, right arm, strike, right leg, stomp. His small stature notwithstanding, the round wooden table soon joined the ongoing cacophony with its periodic creaking, the Worm’s angry susurrus threatening to bloom into full-scale vocal accompaniment. The discord was simply getting…\n\n“Unthinkable!” Creak.\n\n“We’ve gathered here for the express purpose of establishing a covenant! To serve the land and the people as knights! To embody the ideals of chivalry, not play pretend! If your interests lie elsewhere, then so does my time, of which I have wasted plenty trying to get you two to understand what this is all about! If you still don’t? Then we are done here!” Silence befell the room once more.\n\n“Sorry, [Root.Monarch.GetName],” mumbled the Muncher.\n“I apologize,” whispered the Worm.\n\nThe Hound [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] breathed in deeply. A smile managed to find its way back to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face before the exhale was done.\n\n“Alright, come on. We can do the writing part later. You can hold the sword, but do get down from the table. And now, repeat after me, both of you:”"
 flavour_flying_hound.6.a: "Eternal glory and light of chivalry…"
 flavour_flying_hound.7.t: "At the Beast’s Grave"
 flavour_flying_hound.7.d: "“Deadfang, more like dead…fang. That doesn’t work, does it?” The look of confusion on the soldier’s face betrayed the lack of any internal machinations, more so than the silence that followed. In his desire to degrade, thoughts got throttled, and the words entered the world unburdened by the weight of wit one would expect. The inadequacy of the jab was so baffling in fact, that no followup action was planned at all. Whatever had been blurted out up to that point was to be swiftly forgotten by anyone within earshot of the goblin who would soon be known as the lousiest jeer in Escann.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] watched from afar. One of the knights stood in place, swordarm low and limp, the blade touching the ground, with not much reaction from the rest. After a while, the sword was finally appropriated by the soldier next to him, who then presumably began to think of a new jest to share with the group.\n\nThe tied up orcs in the center of the circle continued with their strategy of utter indifference to whatever verbal violations were being inflicted upon them. The freed humans to the side looked as though they were putting great effort into doing nothing at all. [Root.Monarch.GetName], meanwhile, continued to think.\n\nRevenge was screeching as loud as it could, while justice looked on with unwavering composure. Compassion was quietly crying in the corner, with duty mournfully resigned beside it. At the edge of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s vision, a cavalier in full plate, visor covering his face, hand on the swordhilt. Ready for whatever was to come? Or mocking the indecision of present-day knights...\n\n“…defanged!”\n\nAnd in a split second, it all burst into nothingness. Like [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body knew that it was time to stop thinking, that contemplation had to give way to anticipation. Because without it, tragedy would strike. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had but a fleeting moment before a flood of boisterous cheers would wash away any [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] freshly gathered thoughts. [Root.Monarch.GetName] looked to the evening sky, and answered the abstracts."

 flavour_flying_hound.8.t: "The Raven Calls"
 flavour_flying_hound.8.d: "The tension in the room was palpable. Its small windows up high were clearly meant to be used in conjunction with ladders to serve as emergency arrowslits. In times like these, when their job was reduced to letting in whatever remained of the twilight sun, they seemed completely useless. The single ray to cut through the unease was nowhere to be found.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] sat in the tallest chair at the table, surrounded by no fewer than six goblins on each side. Opposite of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] was the only human there, the de jure leader of the has-been adventurer band Raven Banner. Their past delusions of uniting southern Escann fell prey to the onset of goblinic gallantry, and they were now forced to contend with this rather problematic reality. Said contention culminated here, with their final card played and all their hopes laid bare.\n\n“Alas, my good sire, we are but humble knights, and must thus refuse.”\n“I implore you to reconsider, Sir Knight.” They bowed as much as the table allowed.\n“Considered we have, convened even, and we have elected to leave this matter to the people best suited for the job. We would love to extend a helping hand, but we shall not engage the monsters directly. It is not the job of a knight, but of a crusader, to slay the vile vampire with a stake to the heart.”\n“But Sir Knight, what-”\n“This audience is over. You are dismissed.”\n“Sir Knight! But what if you could instead become crusaders?”\n\nSeveral goblin eyes widened at the suggestion, and several more turned to their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who remained staunchly dispassionate despite the outrageous proposition. The adventurer delegate was no longer seated, standing upright with his arm extending forward, fist clenched, mouth still slightly agape. Each breath felt like an eternity ending and beginning anew. Then, moments before the very concept of time was about to collapse, [Root.Monarch.GetName] spoke:"
 flavour_flying_hound.8.a: "Explain further."
 flavour_flying_hound.9.t: "Midnight Ends"
 flavour_flying_hound.9.d: "“And there you have it. Should be most of them, or at least enough so that the dastardly `Masquarade` of theirs needs not be spoken of in the coming millenia.” [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] grinned from ear to ear as  [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] spoke, utterly spoiling any attempt of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] to feign humility. The all too common sounds of shutting doors and windows, presumably at the sight of a goblin in full plate riding a dog, did not manage to impair the celebratory mood.\n\nThe Raven Banner delegate was, understandably, baffled. Their band’s purpose fulfilled, Corvuria was now free of vampires for the foreseeable future, and all he had to sacrifice for it was his dignity. The merry band of short, green and delusional dog riders managed what no man before them could, and the world was better for it. The reality of it all still hadn’t quite sunk in when their leader spoke again:\n\n“Let us then proceed to the matter of payment. When you are instituted on the throne of this radiantly vampire-free kingdom, all the knights of [Root.GetName] shall be officially named crusaders in your name, yes?”\n“That is correct, Sir Knight.” The specifics of who gets to be a crusader was the only lever he could still pull, Adean bless their ignorance.\n“Splendid, splendid. And as for the more worldly rewards, let’s see…”"

Every journey needs a destination, after all.” The Muncher remarked wistfully.\n“That it does, friend. I am glad we get to choose ours.” The Worm smiled at his two compatriots.\n\nThey have gathered there to close a chapter in goblin history. Everything they had done, whether on purpose or not, led them to this moment. The quests and the duels, with all the adventures in between. Their standing as knights, at first just an imitation of pictures in a book, now a core tenet of their very soul. It was time to make it all official.\n\n“That’s official-official. Not spouting whatever comes to mind as we all touch the same sword.”\n“Obviously not, sir.” The Muncher smirked.\n“Who would think to do that?” The Earworm concurred.\n\nAnd so they have spent their last few moments together as a tribe, with very little reminiscing and a lot of dreaming. For tomorrow, they decided, they wake up in a kingdom. Oaths, crowns and thrones mean remarkably little without the power to back them up, but these fellows had more than enough of it to paint the world in their image.\n\nAnd the oath they spoke…"

He looked to his side; his canine companion had just woken up and was now in the process of performing the biggest stretch this side of Silvermere. He joined in, stretching out his arms towards the smoke flap, then sighed, and finally shouted:\n\n“Wezzok!”\n The tent opened a bit quicker than it should have.\n“Is it done, boss?”\n“It is.” He handed over the freshly written letter. “This one goes to Gramzik of Grasshopper Muncher. Just try not to offend him, he gets a bit weird around us these days.”\n“I know, boss. Why not send Zozzok though, boss? That one knows how to bootlick all nice and proper, boss.”\n“Too nice is not proper, Wezzok. He’ll get on their nerves and that’ll be the end of it.”\n“I guess that’s true, boss. That’s why you’re the boss, boss.”\n“[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], Wezzok.”\n“Sorry, boss, I forget these kinds of things. Was there anything else, boss?”\n\nElgek looked back inside his tent. The mutt was sleeping again, and he couldn’t wait to join in. He held back a yawn and turned back to his clansman.\n“Once you’re there, don’t mention that Pagfil Earworm has already agreed to the alliance. Understood?”\n“Understood, boss.”\n“But if all else fails….”\n“If all else fails, boss?”\n“Tell them we’ll be there for them. Even if they refuse.”\n“Even if they refuse, boss?”\n“Yes.

 flavour_flying_hound.12.d: "To [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName],\n\nRegarding the so-called “Goblin Hunters” of Raven Banner, we have managed to ascertain the involvement of at least five individuals in border raids on the territory of Earworm, as well as 587 individuals on the territory of Flying Hound, may eternal glory and light of chivalry shine upon the clan. It needn’t be said, but the discrepancy in figures presented is almost certainly due to the treatment of prisoners by the Worms, as a not insignificant number of captured humans have been subject to what can only be described as “mob justice.” The results of these actions speak for themselves, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but for the sake of recordkeeping, the following acts have been committed so far:\n\n- Drowning: 95 times\n- Suffocation: 12 times\n- Suffocation by drowning: 3 times (likely duplicated data)\n- Dismemberment, leading to bleeding out, leading to death: 43 times\n- Dismemberment, leading to bleeding out, leading to a mercy kill: 39 times\n- Burning: 77 times\n- Brawls: 502 times\n- Honorable duels: 2 times (disputed)\n- Dishonorable duels: 1 time (disputed)\n- Decapitation: 13 times\n- Failed decapitation followed by a wholly different method of execution: 467 times\n- “I don’t (censored) remember” and variations thereof: 1037 times\n\nAs can be seen, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the situation can not be proclaimed to have unfolded as desired. Further instructions are necessary. However, we on the ground collectively came to the conclusion that your presence is not crucial. I personally disagree with that assessment and request your presence, as the several persons of power here in the tent watching me write this do not make me feel as safe as I would like to be.\n\nI eagerly await your decision,\nMay eternal glory and light of chivalry shine,\nWezzok\n\nP.S.

A terrifying beast, praise Castellos it’s no more.”\n“But the blade was lost at Trialmount in 660.”\n“Correct, Elecast VI misplaced it when attempting the Trials of Castan.”\n“And it was only recovered when all those knights went to slay Nichmer in 1021.”\n“Not just knights, many good men and elves from all walks of life were gathered there.”\n“And Clarimode wielded the blade and killed Nichmer?”\n“Yes. And then went on to refound the kingdom-”\n“And you Sword Stewards have kept it safe ever since?”\n“Blade Stewards, but yes. That was until-”\n“And some of you go blind because that sword of yours glows with an awesome power?”\n“Nobody is presently blind, because the Gleaming Blade is broken.”\n“Must not be as awesome as it sounds if it was broken by some random orc.”\n“It was broken by Varok, who was named Bladebreaker in the wake-”\n“We defeated many of them already. The orc fears the Flying Hound.”\n“That is quite enough. We do not wish to see more bloodshed and therefore recognize your rule over the keep, but your sacrilegious intentions are clear as day, and you will not be permitted to gaze upon even the fragments of Calindal.”\n“Oh that’s quite alright, we already have ‘em.”\n“...pardon me?”\n“We had riders sniffing for ‘em all over, and their hounds too. The best goblin smiths in all the realms are gonna get it reforged. And I’m gonna be the best steward you’ve ever seen. The best anybody’s ever seen.”"
 flavour_flying_hound.13.a: "Just wait and see."
 flavour_flying_hound.14.t: "Blinding Gleam"
 flavour_flying_hound.14.d: "The Blade Bailiff.\n\nAn unofficial title, all it really meant was that he was the last one to touch §O(Calindal, the Gleaming Blade)§! before it was handed over to the next hopeful. And so, with an uneasy expression on his face and the fate of the entire Order on his shoulders, he waited. Proud and dignified on the outside, but deep down he felt like part of a vanguard sent to die.\n\nAnd there they are. Two of them this time. Why is one carrying a sack?\n\n“Oh ye of the Order, pray tell, is everything in order and can the ceremony proceed?” The sackless one spoke, the one from before.\n“We have come here today on an auspicious occasion! May eternal glory and light of chivalry shine!” The sacked one hollered in a voice tiring to listen to. Then, [B41.Monarch.GetSheHe] put the bag down and it clinked. Why did it clink?\n“BEHOLD!” They shouted in unison a word most worrying. After instinctively closing his eyes, the Blade Steward mustered up the courage to take a look. \n\nThis part was glued. With wax, maybe? He could still see most of the cracks. Why not there? Ah, they painted it over. The hilt - is that an unmelted nail sticking out? Must be. At least Alos’s fang still serves as the pommel. And they added some from canines, fastened to the dragon’s tooth with leather straps. Deep breaths.\n\nHe took a step forward, and as he did he inadvertently glanced towards the goblins. Bowed down, and quite deeply. Another step. The blade could still be reforged, undoing their work would not be hard. Step. Just a small setback. Halt. Get it over with. Grab the sword.\n\nIt felt like if he held the hilt too tightly, it would shatter once more. But in that moment, he knew. What was broken wasn’t the blade. It was him. After all, what’s important is trying your best. Both of the goblins were then knighted as Stewards, they left with a newfound spring in their step, and no one ever spoke of what transpired, though some say that the Blade Bailiff’s heart grew three sizes that day."

 flavour_flying_hound.15.d: "“And over there, yeah? There’ll be a castle.”\n“What do you need a castle for? You have a keep right here.”\n“Well yeah. But like. A keep’s just a worse castle d'ya s'ppose?”\n“...makes sense.”\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the [B41.Monarch.GetTitle] [B41.Monarch.GetName] were having an exquisite time, relaxing at one of the local hills with a particularly scenic view, drinking fine wine and discussing the future of Bladeskeep. Much work had been done in that regard and much was still being planned, but little by little, the progress was beginning to show on the outside, even to the untrained eye. Soon enough, people would believe the goblins when they told them they’d been knighted as Stewards.\n\n“It’s preposterous isn’t it, the amount of work we have to do ‘ere.”\n“That it is my friend. But appearances matter, and the work of a knight is never over, even if we have to remind people of it.”\n“I guess so boss, sorry, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], ah-”\n“Ah, stuff it [B41.Monarch.GetName], no need for the `Sir Knight`s.”\n“Well, what if I wanted for there to be a need for ‘em…”\n“Hm? What’s that about now?”\n“Well, it’s a bit, uh…”\n\nAfter a good while the back-and-forth came to an end, and the Worm’s intentions became clear. Through all the escapades and quests, the clan had fallen in love with the knightly ways, and were now seeking to properly establish an identity for themselves as the goblin protectors of Escann. How much of that was a true cultural shift and how much the whims of one hopeless romantic, well, did it really matter at this point?"

The dimly lit room lent itself well to a nap, just like the cushioned chair [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was sat on, and indeed, like this whole meeting. You could scour the continent from Khugdihr to the Dragon Coast and still not find an alchemist skilled enough to brew a stimulant for all this boredom.\n\nA quick prod from behind jolted [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] awake, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] page gesturing to the petitioners in the room. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] could really go for a duel right about now. But duty called, and the knightly kind was not contained to battle, no matter how hard [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wished it were.\n“Remind me again, oh fair subjects of mine, of your names.”\n\n“Zzezuk, son of Zezzuk, my liege.”\n“Wozzka, daughter of Wezzok, my liege.”\n\n“Alright, as your liege, I would be fantastically delighted if you could please summarize your positions on the matter in one sentence.

 flavour_flying_hound.100.d: "Traditionally advancing armies have been expected to supply themselves from what they can plunder in the area they move through. This is often the only way for soldiers to survive in wartime as payments from the [Root.GovernmentName] treasury can rarely be brought in a timely manner to the men. In fact, by paying retroactively many also avoid the strain of paying for the fallen.\nAs [flying_hound_occupied_capital.GetName] fell it was therefore expected that our soldiers be allowed to loot the city to enrich themselves. What was less expected was the total and utter destruction of the city that took place. Refusing to follow orders our men descended upon the helpless burghers, doing despicable things and ruining the area for a long time to come."

 flavour_flying_hound.300.d: "Many goblins of the [Root.GetName] clan feel a strong connection to one specific aspect of the stories of old, but few devote their whole lives to understanding them in their entirety. Even among those that do, it is rare to find an individual whose character and deeds so closely align with their favourite fictional chevaliers. Such individuals are sometimes called Emulants, and the bibliophiles of [Root.GetName] have noted that the great bravery, chivalry and pride of [Root.Monarch.GetName] may mark them as one of the most swell knights to ever grace Escann. Several easily impressed goblins have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to recommend further contemplation of specific plot points in the stories they like, though there appears to be a split among them about which tomes exactly we might dedicate our time to. Spending many of your waking hours reading, studying, and possibly even understanding a new book would take your focus from the direct administration of the realm and require the delegation of some important responsibilities, but could yield major knightly prowess. Will you pursue the wonders of chivalry further, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"

 flavour_flying_hound.301.da: "Every realm as it exists in the present is built on the glorious and effulgent skeleton of past tales, and [Root.GetName] is no different. The relations between a prince and their subjects are the product of centuries of disagreements and compromises, centralization and disintegration of power, and the changing character of the individuals around whom power flows. Navigating these relationships and privileges can be maddening, but with a patient soul and a just heart it is not only possible, but necessary for the right function of a realm.\n\nYou remind yourself of this mantra as you are once again called to settle a dispute between several of your vassals, minor established hound riders who profess contradictory statements concerning the number of adventurers killed, the size of obstacles jumped, and a dozen other honor-wounding matters. Settling these disputes is far from anyone's favorite topic, but you are readier than most to take it on, knowing that your subjects look at you all the while, gasping in awe at the quality of gallantry emanating from your apparel, and the infinite pride contained within your poise. Most who attempt to emulate the archetypal chevaliers do so from the saddle, sword in hand, shouting about glory to no one in particular, but you have come to understand that the courtly feudal apparatus of it all hangs on by a mere thread, and it’s best that the source of said thread is a tremendously regal mantle on your shoulders. One by one, you have astounded all the seemingly endless groups come to petition you for something or other. They will come tomorrow too. But with the gallant pride that only a true knight can display, you will make your realm fairer, more efficient, and better for everyone living in it - just as soon as the diadem is back from polishing."
 flavour_flying_hound.301.db: "The riders were splendid in their panoply, late afternoon sun glinting off of steel and highlighting the colors of [Root.GetName]. Your elite guard was all saddled up and stood at attention beside their mounts as you passed - but to you, they were far more than that. Many an hour you had spent sparring, dining, and discussing with these great warriors, many of whom were hopeful of one day winning the grand tourney and claiming leadership of the [Root.GovernmentName]. Though they wore stoic faces now, if you were to flash them a smile you know that you might evoke a reaction, for these were your noble and chivalric brethren, who were as dedicated to you as you were to them. Many times you have toasted each other's health, ridden into battle in tandem, and emerged from the crucible of war together, stronger. When you have been wounded, they have rescued you; When one of you has fallen, the rest have borne the body of their gallant companion away.\n\nMemories of these deeds of triumph and sacrifice are of course grossly exaggerated, with much of them still being contained to the realm of imagination and revisionism of the early days of the clan. But when one starts doubting, suddenly the Muncher and the Worm are there beside them, patting them on the back, reminiscing of the times when together they fought and routed many a scoundrel away from their home. Whether adventurer or orc, no one dares doubt the charge of the resplendent goblin knights against other claimants to the ruined kingdoms of this land.\n\nYou find your knights looking at you, their faces impassive but their eyes intense, waiting for a word from their commander. These goblins will follow you into hell, for you are their knight, and they are yours. Together, you will be the living representation of mounted chivalry - and in your thoughts and, hopefully, deeds, you will outgrow the legends of old. Figure of speech, of course. A goblin on a dog is still smaller than just the horse of an Addener Knight."

 #Government Reforms
 B43_embrace_high_chivalry_reform: "Embrace High Chivalry"
 B43_embrace_high_chivalry_reform_desc: "The clans of Flying Hound, Grasshopper Muncher and Earworm, formerly of the Prideful Bunch, have come together to overcome the past and face the future. The old ways of deferring to the goblin with the biggest weapon or mount, sometimes cited as “Khuyu vund khuyu nezkaru” (common: their hound his rules) have been superseded by election via tournament. Now, the rulership is granted to the most courageous, chivalric and gallant of knights, with the shiniest sword and proudest poise being mere supplements."
 B43_knightly_goblinoid_kingdom_reform: "Knightly Goblinoid Kingdom"
 B43_knightly_goblinoid_kingdom_reform_desc: "In the past, kingdoms of goblins and other goblinoids tended to be loosely administrated, with no formal laws or rules of succession. However, the advancement of Flying Hound into the early modern age has seen it adopt these aspects of governance in the image of the Escanni kingdoms of old. This distinguished it from their peers, whose nobility was often weaker and looser than that of the human kingdoms, on account of the inherited tribal social mobility. The High Kingdom meanwhile embraced the knightly ways in every aspect of life, which gave rise to a vast aristocratic class, evergrowing in their desire to prove themselves on the battlefield."

 estate_nobles_patronage_of_the_chivalric_ways_privilege_desc: "The perennial traditions of chivalric Escann are promoted and sponsored by the state. In exchange for tax cuts just high enough to not be mistaken for lip service, each member of the noble class is expected to behave as befits a gallant knight. The resulting enthusiasm for courtesy, honor and benevolence manifests itself in their collective readiness to die."

 estate_nobles_unbreakable_knights_privilege_desc: "When our soldiers march to war they do so knowing full well that their future accomplishments far outweigh their past misdeeds.

 estate_nobles_feed_the_homeland_privilege_desc: "When our soldiers march to war, they do so knowing full well that the entirety of our proud nation is behind them!

It seems to work well enough, maybe some of them like working at the court because they don’t want to risk their lives in battle? Bah!"


 #Church Aspect
 chivalry_cult: "Chivalry Cult"
 chivalry_cult_desc: "An eclectic cult with its basis found in the many stories the goblins have learned ever since landing in Escann. Strongly tied to the cult of Avatars, it puts emphasis on emulation of the gallant knights of old, rather than veneration of any particular god. Origins of Goblinic Shamanism notwithstanding, humans in the realm have taken well to this particular aspect of their cult, and many of them find it hard to distinguish from the teachings found in Adeanic sermons."
