 I78_conclave_of_the_remaining_title:0 "Conclave of the Remaining"
 I78_conclave_of_the_remaining_desc:0 "The very point of a “conclave” is to bring together the entire realm, from great to small, to decide on a course of action at some pivotal point. It is now impossible to bring together the entire realm- they are all dead in Yarikhoi. Regardless, we shall have to do the best we can. The Caehn Khailmak shall convene his most trusted advisors, the ordsikar and clan heads, and what family he has that survived the Incursion, and we shall all figure out a way to pick up the pieces of what was once the Wild Hunt."

 I78_reing_in_the_caehns_title:0 "Rein in the Caehns"
 I78_reing_in_the_caehns_desc:0 "Caehns tend to think quite highly of themselves- perhaps this is simply the nature of one who would rise to the rank of Caehn. Although all Caehns across the plains would proclaim themselves as the greatest Caehnate, in our case this boasting was justified. Our subjects stretched as far as the plain grasses, and their loyalty was absolute.\n\nOf course, this glorious state of affairs died with the armies of the Incursion. Many of the lesser Caehns who swore fealty to us during the Incursion have simply terminated their relationship with us, and what few have not seek to extort us to the degree an outsider would say we are their subject instead of the other way around. \n\nWhat is missing from our relationship these days is fear. We will show our subjects that we are great and unified, and they will shelter themselves under our great banner once again."

 I78_rebuild_the_shamans_title:0 "Rebuild the Shamans"
 I78_rebuild_the_shamans_desc:0 "The magical resources of a clan are to be stewarded carefully, for their decline or collapse can mean the collapse of the state just as often. In our desire to cause pain to the Triunics we forgot this, and now we have no more shamans and are on the brink of collapse.\n\nIt is important to use what resources we have effectively, of course, but it is now even more important to build up our stock of shamans for the future. We must devote more effort than ever to the instruction of the next generation of shamans in combination with the efforts of the sects of Irdaeos."

 I78_commute_with_irdaeos_title:0 "Commune with Irdaeos"
 I78_commute_with_irdaeos_desc:0 "It is very rare that Irdaeos makes his will known to his people. For this reason, the religiously inclined are left to interpret the events of the world as signs of Irdaeos’ favor or disfavor, and the series of events that has happened after the Incursion leaves no doubt to them that we are disfavored. If we are to ever recover and bring our vengeance to the Triunics, we will need every centaur in the realm to fight, and that includes our skeptics.\n\nIf we are to change their minds, we must grant sacrifice to Irdaeos in the way he loves most- death and terror on the battlefield. There are many other centaur clans surrounding us, and what weaklings they have decided to call warriors are no match for the host of the Wild Hunt. We shall remind the skeptics of this, and be rewarded for it both by the satisfaction of Irdaeos and a shoring up of our political position."

 I78_a_show_of_authority_title:0 "A Show of Authority"
 I78_a_show_of_authority_desc:0 "The name of the Wild Hunt was once known across all the plains as one of the most glorious and renowned of all the Caehnates, and now is known for not much at all except for the failure of the Incursion. While we perhaps are not as strong as we once were, this is mistaken. Enough of our strength remains, and what we do not have now we can rebuild.\n\nLet us show the clans of the plains how mistaken they are. We shall make examples of our neighbors in the hopes that their ignominious ends inspire the beginnings of respect among the others once again."

 I78_return_of_the_caehnate_title:0 "Return of the Caehnate"
 I78_return_of_the_caehnate_desc:0 "To be Caehn is the highest honor a centaur can aspire to. There are many Caehns who cannot live up to the name, but we were not one of them until recently, as the Wild Hunt collapsed into infighting and decline. Through that period, we were called Caehn- now it is time to be Caehn again."

 I78_unite_the_clan_title:0 "Unite the Clan"
 I78_unite_the_clan_desc:0 "Even in the best of times it takes a great ruler to exert authority over the clans and ordsiwyn of the Wild Hunt. These are not the best of times, and the free clans have been left to their own devices for a long, long time. They might enjoy their independence now, yet there is a reason the clans chose to swear fealty to the Caehn in the first place- we and them are greater than the sum of our parts.\n\nThrough a long journey the Caehn and his personal host will take across the Wild Hunt, we will remind them of this fact. The mission will culminate in a ceremony in the Caehn’s own camp, where the clans and ordisiwyn will renew their bonds with the Caehn, and there will be food, song, and much rejoicing."

 I78_the_shamans_conclave_title:0 "The Shamans Conclave"
 I78_the_shamans_conclave_desc:0 "In the years before the Incursion, the shamans fought with one another about any number of things. They formed great sects and factions, and warred with one another in court and on the battlefield about the direction the Wild Hunt should take.\n\nThese days there are simply not enough shamans to waste their numbers on foolish infighting, yet the old rivalries endure and threaten to bubble up once the old factions regain enough of their strength. In this fragile peace born of weakness, we must take actions to reconcile the shamans with one another. We will invite them all to a conclave of glory and splendor, and we will provide them with everything they could ever want while they talk to and learn from one another. We will not allow them to leave until they have forged a lasting understanding with one another."

 I78_a_title_to_earn_title:0 "A Title to Earn"
 I78_a_title_to_earn_desc:0 "Where the other races find unity in order, we centaurs find it in chaos. The plains are in constant flux, and the only constant is the fighting, both between ourselves and with outsiders. This has made us strong, but it means that we cannot ever unite to take the fight to our enemies, who in their unity see us as little but future targets of conquest.\n\nThe centaur tribes need another Great Caehn, but because every Caehn seeks to rise above his fellows the fighting does not ever end. This is why if we are ever to guide the centaurs to a better future, we must stop the fighting without bloodshed. We must make our enemies our friends by proving to them we have more that unites us than what divides us. We will declare ourselves protectors of the plains, and we will ask for no compensation for our services but friendship and gratitude."

 I78_the_return_of_authority_title:0 "The Return of Authority"
 I78_the_return_of_authority_desc:0 "Authority is often defined more by what it does not do than what it does. Power blusters, rages and screams to do what authority can accomplish with a quiet word. Power is brittle- it is tied to the material where authority lives in the heart and minds of its subjects.\n\nThe New Lords of the plains are power. They have spread like the grasses of the plains across lands that are foreign to them, and they have attempted to buy the loyalty of the populace with ostentatious displays of pomp and glory.\n\nWe are authority. Our word is law across the plains, and our lineage stretches back to Naegol. We will show these jumped-up ordsikar what it means to have authority, and when their power breaks no one will remember them."

 I78_heirs_of_irdaeos_title:0 "Heirs of Irdaeos"
 I78_heirs_of_irdaeos_desc:0 "A centaur that is not loyal to Irdaeos is not a centaur at all. We have not forgotten all that Irdaeos has done for us, and every centaur of the Caehnate itches to reconcile themselves with him to atone for the failures of ourselves and our ancestors in the Incursion.\n\nOne of the most important steps along this long path to reconciliation is to prove ourselves in battle to make it clear that the loss against the Triunics does not represent our martial capabilities. Although we are not yet ready for vengeance against the Triunics, battle can take many forms, from ritual skirmishes with the centaurs on our borders to grand martial tournaments between the brave warriors of the Caehnate. We shall do both these and more, and make it clear to Irdaeos that we remain his children, as we always have been and always shall be."

 I78_rebuild_the_warriors_title:0 "Rebuild the Warriors"
 I78_rebuild_the_warriors_desc:0 "For far too long, one of the main problems in the Wild Hunt was famine- we had plenty of arable land but not the people to work it. After a long period of recovery, the children born in the aftermath of the incursion have grown strong and hale, and we can once again begin to grow our influence to meet our borders. Let us work the land again, and create such plenty that the soldiers of the Wild Hunt eat like Caehns and the deprivations of the past are nothing but a distant memory."

 I78_protector_of_the_steppes_title:0 "Protector of the Steppes"
 I78_protector_of_the_steppes_desc:0 "The relationship of a clan to itself is a strange thing. Two clan members can be at each other’s throats for decades and do incomparable harm to one another as the bitterest of enemies, yet the second someone from outside the clan would seek to do the same, those two clan members will fight for each other as if they were friends all their lives.\n\nIt is much the same among us centaurs- we kill one another’s armies and raze one anothers’ lands, but there is a bond between centaurs that defies all the outside world might seek to do to destroy it. As the greatest of the Caehnates, this means that it is our responsibility to protect all the centaurs of the steppes from outsiders with all the strength of our nation. In the fullness of time, we might even earn their respect."

 I78_mortal_hunger_title:0 "Mortal Hunger"
 I78_mortal_hunger_desc:0 "Now that our numbers are rising to pre-Incursion levels, it is time to resume our commercial bonds with the outside world. During our decline, what few trade routes exist across the plains were not adequately guarded, and there was precious little to trade on them anyway. Despite this, trade is power, and we have not forgotten what links we had with the other Caehnates, or how to restore them. We will build up our great herds again, and we will engage in commerce with the others to support our growing population."

 I78_almighty_caehn_title:0 "Almighty Caehn"
 I78_almighty_caehn_desc:0 "We have proven ourselves beyond measure to be great warriors, and this is why all the plains belong to us. When we conquered the other Caehnates we razed their lands and killed their Caehns so that we might break them entirely.\n\nNow we must rebuild what we have broken. The other centaurs are our brothers, and we must not forget that the same virtues that require us to be defiant to the last in our defeats require us to be magnanimous in our victory. By accepting the other centaurs, we can integrate their clans and traditions into our Caehnate for the benefit of us both. We have earned the fealty of the conquered- let us now earn their loyalty."

 I78_the_cause_taken_title:0 "The Cause Taken"
 I78_the_cause_taken_desc:0 "When the Wild Hunt fell into decline and weakness, even our enemies felt a sense of sadness. Although our enemies despised us with the fury of untold years of border feuds and honor killings, they knew that the Wild Hunt was the best hope of centaurkind, and our fall represented the great victory of the Triunics.\n\nAccordingly, our rise is the rise of the centaurs, and all the other Caehns know of our desire to right the wrongs of the Incursion. With the influence we have accrued from our actions, we must convince the other centaurs to cease their fighting for a time and take up the greater cause- vengeance against all the Triunics, and centaur dominance of the lakes."

 I78_united_hoofs_title:0 "United Hooves"
 I78_united_hoofs_desc:0 "It is a glorious feeling to run across the plains- to know the power and freedom that Irdaeos has granted us in his domain. Yet to run or even to walk, all four legs must work in tandem. If even one of the four decided to detach itself from the control of the whole, even the swiftest centaur would collapse on the ground into a twitching mess. \n\nAs it is for one centaur, so it is for the state- to achieve our goals requires unity. City Razer, Bloodbringer, Ruin Bringer, Wild Hunt- all four Caehnates must be united as one. It is only then that we will be able to run the way we were meant to, and to build up enough speed to trample our enemies to death."

 I78_the_tools_of_war_title:0 "The Tools of War"
 I78_the_tools_of_war_desc:0 "In the First Incursion, it was the mages of the Wild Hunt who brought the armies of the plains to the Triunics with the power of their ice magics. Without them our invasion would have been doomed before it started, and as it was then so it is now. If we do not develop the shamans to lead our armies to victory, our invasion is doomed.\n\nThe state of our shaman population is not as dire as it was in the days after the Incursion, but there is still more that needs to be done to train the new generation of shamans for war. We will make great schools to instruct our shamans in the ice magics that our enemies learned to fear, and we will be rewarded for it by the screams of the Triunics as they freeze to death."

 I78_foretold_by_the_wise_title:0 "Foretold by the Wise"
 I78_foretold_by_the_wise_desc:0 "There are many lands outside the plains, and the people there have discovered new weapons and new tactics that are not yet known to our people. If we are to have any hope of standing against the outsiders, we must learn their ways of war.\n\nThis modernization is not a betrayal of the ways of Irdaeos, but the most faithful interpretation of his teachings. A people that cannot change with the times is a weak people, and a weak people is a conquered people. Irdaeos favors strength, and it is this strength that will grant us the power to destroy the Triunics once and for all in accordance with his will. We must bring the knowledge of the outsiders here and distribute it among our people."

 I78_relentless_revengence_title:0 "Relentless Revengence"
 I78_relentless_revengence_desc:0 "The Triunics look at us from across the lakes. What they see are untamed and savage lands that could prosper under the guidance of their civilization and their three goddesses, were it not for all the centaurs. They are right. These lands are untamed and savage- they are the lands of the Wild Hunt. The Wild Hunt is all that the Triunics fear, and for good reason. When they left the best of a generation of centaurs to fertilize their lands of Yarikhoi, the Triunics made an enemy of not only the Wild Hunt, but of all centaurkind. We have not forgotten the way our ancestors died.\n\nAs the enemies of the Triunics, we will prove ourselves all that they fear. We will smash the idols of the goddesses. We will destroy their wretched cities and replace them with the grasses of our plains. We will flay their women and children alive and we will laugh while doing it, for revenge is not a solemn duty but a gift we have been given by virtue of our strength.\n\nRejoice, sons of Irdaeos! It is time to take your due."

 #Events
 flavour_wild_hunt.0.t: "Shattered Invasion"
 flavour_wild_hunt.0.d: "Our Caehnate has shattered upon the Four Lands. The vile Jolgik Uts sought out our shamans and killed them dishonorably. Tens of thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands of centaurs, some of the most powerful and honorable Ordsikar, lie slain with the rest of their ordsiwyn in the bloodbath that occurred. Our only solace is that so many proud centaurs are now with Irdaeos in Ik Magthaal. Of the Ordsiwyn that were not completely wiped out, many are left with next to no able-bodied men left, and many have already abandoned our Caehnate and revoked their membership, striking it out on their own, or joining up with different nearby Caehnates, capitalizing on the current state of affairs. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a long path ahead of him if he wishes to carve out the future for our Caehnate and gallop out of the grip of destruction. More and more Ordsikar withdraw their ordsiwyn from the caehnate daily. If nothing is done, the Wild Hunt will soon fade into dust in the steppe wind."
 flavour_wild_hunt.0.a: "An All-Consuming Storm is upon us."

 flavour_wild_hunt.1.t: "Eastern Caehn Calls For Help"
 flavour_wild_hunt.1.d: "In the days after the Great Incursion the Triunic mages scattered our Caehnate to the breezes blowing across the plains, which carried our friends to lands we still do not maintain regular contact with. One such friend was the Ruin Bringer clan, which almost alone among the clans of Nuzurbokh sees Irdaeos as we do. Unfortunately, our weakness and theirs in the aftermath of the Great Incursion has made them a ripe target for their enemies, and they have been drawn into a war they are not likely to win.\n\nWe of the Filustkhuga know that loyalty is as important as glory, as it is impossible to have one without the other. It is for this reason that the Ruin Bringers have called on us to honor both Irdaeos and our friendship with them and assist in their war. What shall be our response?"
 flavour_wild_hunt.1.a: "Our war is ours, and their war is theirs."
 flavour_wild_hunt.1.b: "The Filustkhuga ride together!"

 flavour_wild_hunt.2.t: "Calm After the Storm"
 flavour_wild_hunt.2.d: "After the First Incursion, the Wild Hunt had reason to fear. The Triunics sought revenge, the surrounding Caehnates looked with greedy eyes towards our land, and the ordsikars jockeyed for status as the problems of the Wild Hunt mounted.\n\nIn the middle of this storm, the Wild Hunt appeared doomed. We could have chosen submission. Instead, we rebuilt. We grew stronger than we were before. We learned from our failings. Above all, we did not lose sight of our goal- vengeance now not only for every centaur killed by the Triunics before, but for our clan members and family killed in the Incursion.\n\nThe sneering Caehns of distant lands, jealous of our heritage and our guidance, sought to discredit us by claiming we were doomed- that we were trapped inside a storm. They did not realize that we are favored by Irdaeos, who controls the storms. They did not realize that we are not trapped in the storm, we are the storm."
 flavour_wild_hunt.2.a: "Let the Triunics hide, for our vengeance will be great and terrible."

 flavour_wild_hunt.3.t: "Challenge the New Lords"
 flavour_wild_hunt.3.d: "In our period of decline, the plains have moved on without us. The clans farther away from the lakes have not suffered as we have, and they have taken the time after the Incursion to build a Caehnate they are claiming is greater than ours ever was. Their currency has spread as far as our markets. On its obverse is minted a picture of their ruler. On the reverse, an image of the skull of Wild Hunt broken in half, to commemorate the “Great Defeat of Buruvaqoyla.”\n\nThis is unambiguous- they seek to drag the good name of our Caehnate through the mud for the sake of their own petty political machinations. They care nothing for the fate of the centaurs, or vengeance for our ancestors. They would not even care if the Triunics killed us all, so long as they were killed last. The court cries out at their injustice. What shall we do in response?"
 flavour_wild_hunt.3.a: "We will show them what it means to rule."
 flavour_wild_hunt.3.b: "We should not waste our time on old ghosts."

 flavour_wild_hunt.4.t: "The Second Incursion"
 flavour_wild_hunt.4.d: "Our enemies live where the wide grass of the plains tapers into bridges of grass, which they have fortified with the fervor only cowards can. Yet despite their pathetic mien and weak government, the Triunics know a fundamental truth- there is not room in these plains for centaurs and humans both. Our eternal cycle of conflict will only end once one of us has eradicated the other. The victor will accumulate the rich rewards of conquest, and the loser will be driven from their home.\n\nThe Wild Hunt has two goals. The first goal is to claim our right as centaurs of dominion over Yarikhoi and all who live on it. This alone would be sufficient for some, but not us. Our second goal is to make the Triunics pay, as they would do to us if we ever grew weak enough to give them the chance. The Triunics must die, but that does not mean they must suffer. We will make them suffer for fun.\n\nAcross the plains, we have made contact with others who feel the same. All of us are agreed: now is the time to strike. We have learned from the lessons of the First Incursion, but its goals remain as urgent as ever, and now is the time to achieve them. We will send out the call to our allies. We will assemble our host. We will ride to the border at Jogligkunazmoq, and we will kill their first defender. We will send the rest of his kind to join him."
 flavour_wild_hunt.4.a: "Let the plains arm and the lake fear."

 flavour_wild_hunt.5.t: "The Call of the Wild"
 flavour_wild_hunt.5.d: "On the plains, sound travels far. This is why it has become undeniable- there is a new sound on the plains. It is the sound of our neighbors preparing for war, for the Great Caehn of the Wild Hunt has sent a call from the edges of the Serpent Gift to the forests of Nuzurbokh. He says that the centaurs are stronger and wiser now, and that at the edge of the plains are a people whose very existence is a crime against Irdaeos.\n\nThe call of the Great Caehn echoes over the quiet waving of the grasses and the gusts of wind. The Great Caehn says we are once again to wage war against the Triunics."
 flavour_wild_hunt.5.a: "AND WE SHALL ANSWER!"

 flavour_wild_hunt.6.t: "Spirits of Vengence"
 flavour_wild_hunt.6.d: "The victorious general set down his sword and collapsed against the wall of his tent. The outcome was ensured by Irdaeos, yet there was something strange about this battle. At one point, the Triunics had split their forces to attempt a flank, but he knew with a confidence he did not usually have that the correct maneuver was a withdrawal from the left so that the shock troops in the trees could perform an envelopment. This was not strange itself, but someone else seemed to give the order, and the shock units that intercepted the enemy seemed somewhat larger than he remembered at the time.\n\nThe general gave his canteen one last gulp and emerged into the bustle of the warcamp on his way to debrief with his council. He was not trying to eavesdrop, but the conversation among every group of warriors was the same: there were others in that battle. There were stories of relief from nowhere and mysterious routs of the Triunics to units that did not exist. One centaur swore up and down that he saw his father in his warband, who died years ago during the First Incursion.\n\nThe general’s staff all had similar stories. Communications along the front were too efficient for the number of runners they had, and scouting reports were too detailed. Something was happening.\n\nMuster for march the next day did not reveal any more troops than the general had, not that he expected any different. But as the army set out to its next destination, the general saw the outline of a glimmer of a centaur, who looked at him and nodded."
 flavour_wild_hunt.6.a: "Perhaps we are all correct."

 flavour_wild_hunt.7.t: "Ultakal Surrenders"
 flavour_wild_hunt.7.d: "The island of Ultakal is one of the most prestigious holdings in all of the Lake Federation due to its sizable gold mines. These days, though, prestige as a motivator for the people of the Lake Federation has been displaced by more pedestrian concerns, such as avoiding starvation or getting shot through with arrows.\n\nIt is this first motivator that was likely the motivator of the communication sent to us by the commander of the garrison of Ultakal. After our successful siege of the capital of [5239.Owner.GetName], they have decided to surrender under the logic that aid is not likely to be forthcoming anytime soon, and it is impossible to eat gold. Our forces already have the island under occupation."
 flavour_wild_hunt.7.a: "A wise decision."

 flavour_wild_hunt.8.t: "Unbelievable"
 flavour_wild_hunt.8.d: "Mavelos Stonebreaker woke up and prepared himself for another grinding day of siege. His army had been camped out in front of the fort for an unreasonably long time, especially for a people whose entire existence was based around movement. In jokes with his warband they had privately named the place “The Block”, because nobody ever came in and nobody ever went out.\n\nOf course, Mavelos had reason to be thankful. His job was the easiest in the entire army: he guarded the front gate to make sure nobody left for supplies. If nothing else, it was an opportunity to sit and reflect. Mavelos was thinking of beginning to write his memoirs.\n\nToday would not be the day he started on that, however. A crash came from inside the fort, followed by another crash. Mavelos rang the bell to alert the camp of activity, and a horde of centaurs came stampeding from the main encampment. A last terrible crash came from the fort, and the iron doors of the fort came off their hinges. The army braced for impact, but only one creature came from inside the fort, and it had four legs- was that a centaur? Mavelos supposed it was his job to figure out what was going on. He gripped his sword and approached the strange centaur.\n\nMavelos held his sword in front of him. He drew closer and closer, until his sword came loose from his hands, flew up, and somersaulted away into the horizon. The centaur spoke: “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” One hundred questions came to Mavelos at the same time. As he opened his mouth to ask the first, the centaur interrupted him: “You don’t need to worry about that, that, or the other thing you were going to ask. They’re all dead.” The breeze picked up. Mavelos could smell copper.\n\nThis was some form of elaborate prank. Sputtering for breath, Mavelos desperately managed to get out one word: “Why?” The centaur walked past him on his way to rejoin the road. He turned back to Mavelos, and with a slightly pitying look he said, "It comes with the job…”"
 flavour_wild_hunt.8.a: "...I am a witcher after all."

 flavour_wild_hunt.9.t: "Words in the Blood"
 flavour_wild_hunt.9.d: "Journal,\n\nMy brother died today. We had prepared for the possibility of the centaur host was approaching, of course, but one tends to discount the possibility of things happening to them until they do. We had heard the stories- heads on pikes, charred corpses burned in tribute pyres to their barbaric god (for they only have the one) being dragged behind the host to demoralize the defenders, entire villages trampled by stampedes- but the news from the Khoidang’s office had said that they were weeks away from our fair city. Come to think of it, the news has been getting less detailed lately.\n\nWe were hunting outside the city (and this was our first mistake) for game we might preserve and cure for food to eat once the siege began, and I heard thunder. I looked up for fear it was raining, but the sky was as clear as ever- the thunder was coming from the horizon.\n\nWe realized at the same time. I hid inside a hollow log, and he hid in a nearby tree. The thunder grew and it grew, until it was in the sky and the earth both, and it seemed like there would never be anything else. That was when my brother fell out of the tree. The army didn’t even stop to kill him, his body simply broke under hoof. Eventually, one of the stragglers stooped to look at him. He took my brother’s molars, put them in a bag, and rode off behind the thunder. He was fifteen. Enuuk help me, he was fifteen- any older and he would have been at the front.\n\nI don’t think I’m going back to the city. I couldn’t face our mother. If they were going to our city, then the militia doesn’t stand a chance, and then it would be my corpse splayed out as a battle standard. I am going far away from here, assuming the centaurs don’t find me on the way. I could join one of the armies of the Federation instead, but the way things are going,"
 flavour_wild_hunt.9.a: "”I don’t think there will be a Federation much longer."

 flavour_wild_hunt.10.t: "Amongst the Storm"
 flavour_wild_hunt.10.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood outside the torchlight of the camp and gazed upon the stars. The sights of the plains were by this point easily recallable, but seeing them for another time always brought [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] joy. Tonight, there was a storm brewing on the horizon, too. It looked to be approaching the camp, and the rain was already picking up.\n\nThere was something different about the storm tonight. As the wind swirled and the rain poured, [Root.Monarch.GetName] came up with the difference: there was a presence tonight. It was present in the clouds above, and it was present in the lightning of the storm, and it was present in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], too.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] left the camp and began to run towards the lightning. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] ran over dirt congealing into mud as if it was stone, and as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] ran, the lightning began striking closer and closer, until the sky loosed a terrible peal of thunder, and a bolt of lightning struck [Root.Monarch.GetName] directly.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was not harmed. The presence from before had taken [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] over, and as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] began to run faster (for [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could run so much faster than [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had, and it was only now that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could see that), the blessings of Irdaeos came to [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s mind unprompted. The welcoming of the centaurs to the plains and the navigation of the Wild Hunt through its lean times were not luck, they were fate itself guided by Irdaeos, who holds dominion over the land and sky.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] came to a halt in the middle of the camp again, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] saw that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] pelt was lanced with angry red streaks and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hoofs were coated in a soot that was not there when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] began to run. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] also saw that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] followers were bowing to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and the moon shone on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] alone, and the grasses were whistling,"
 flavour_wild_hunt.10.a: "Here is my Chosen, who holds dominion over my earth."

 flavour_wild_hunt.11.t: "Winds of the Waken"
 flavour_wild_hunt.11.d: "Our people are a mobile one. The reason we are sons of Irdaeos is because we left the lands of Rohibos, and it is Irdaeos’ word that a centaur only stops moving when he is dead or broken. It is the creed of our people that for however good a land is there is always somewhere better, until we are brought to the paradise of Ik Magthaal.\n\nIt is this tendency that has made us great which has now been turned against us. One of the minor clans is claiming that our weakness and instability has made our lands unsuitable, and now seek to make their fortune anywhere else so long as it is not here."
 flavour_wild_hunt.11.a: "Give them anything they want, so long as they do not leave."
 flavour_wild_hunt.11.b: "May their great horizon swallow them whole."

 flavour_wild_hunt.12.t: "Dead Men Tell Tales"
 flavour_wild_hunt.12.d: "A verifiable haunting requires both consistency and witnesses. For the last month, a ghostly centaur has appeared within the fields of [Root.Capital.GetName]. Bigger than even our mightiest warriors, their presence was initially seen as a sign of good fortune. A glorious soldier of wars past, here to see us regain our former glory. Then the performance started. Invisible swords cut at his flesh. Arrows exposed muscle. Grass was pinned down by what must have been blood. Half an arm fell to the ground. The rest of the warrior wasn't too far behind. Night after night this grisly display was repeated. Unseen foes cutting down what would've easily been the strongest centaur in living memory. The few remaining shamans were clueless. The scarce amount of diplomats were even more so. Even when soldiers attempted to protect the centaur from the unseen foes, its fate was the same.\n\nAfter weeks of the spectacle repeating itself a young soldier, as of yet unproven in any combat, asked the ghost if there was any way to avoid his fate. The warrior stopped fighting- even as vicious wounds still appeared across his body. Solemnly, he whispered a single word that the young centaur would never quite be able to forget."
 flavour_wild_hunt.12.a: "Nay"

 flavour_wild_hunt.13.t: "Lack of Shamans"
 flavour_wild_hunt.13.d: "On the empty plains, a clan’s shamans are its life- they call its rain, carve its glyphs, and maintain order and stability under its domain. Unfortunately, most of our shamans died in Yarikhoi at the hands of the Triunics, and now our land suffers from drought, poverty, and unrest.\n\nWhat few shamans remain are mostly those who were too young or too old to fight in the Incursion, or else those who had so little talent that it was not worth bringing them. Every one of them has been working to do the tasks of four of their dead brethren, but their efforts still are not enough. As we have every year since our war was lost, we now face a choice- tell our shamans to work even harder or tell our people we have failed them."
 flavour_wild_hunt.13.a: "We must wring every last drop of talent out of our shamans!"
 flavour_wild_hunt.13.b: "Life will be harder now, and the people must see that."

 flavour_wild_hunt.14.t: "Subjects Challenge Caehn"
 flavour_wild_hunt.14.d: "On the plains, there is a natural order to things. Centaurs form clans, clans form Ordsiwyn, and Ordsiwyn form Caehnates. The greatest of these Caehnates go on to extract oaths of fealty from other Caehns. At each step of this great chain, oaths are made. The patron promises to protect and nurture the client, and the client promises undying loyalty to the patron.\n\nThese oaths are made because the natural conclusion of disunity on the plains is death, whether by the elements or by civil war. The vassal Caehns appear to have forgotten this simple fact, as they scheme over who will rule the pile of bones that will be left of our Caehnate should they manage to overthrow the natural order through their sheer disloyalty."
 flavour_wild_hunt.14.a: "They will be put back in their place, forcefully."

 flavour_wild_hunt.15.t: "Local Questions our Right"
 flavour_wild_hunt.15.d: "There is finally some activity in our ruined lands, but it does not appear to be the good kind. In recent days, a wanderer without even a clan named Kavelos Truthseeker has been stirring up sentiment against the rule of the Caehn, who he claims is a “representation of Irdaeos’ displeasure” and “the squanderer of a bloodline of conquerors.” These appear to be popular sentiments among the commoners.\n\nNow that someone has given voice to sentiments that were previously aired in private spaces, his following grows by the day. As he travels across the land even our court is consumed by whispers, and a tension is building as our rule is challenged."
 flavour_wild_hunt.15.a: "These are words spoken from weakness and envy."
 flavour_wild_hunt.15.b: "We need not respond to every insignificant."

 flavour_wild_hunt.16.t: "Humans Threaten Border"
 flavour_wild_hunt.16.d: "When the first troops of the Incursion crossed the first bridges of ice, they were greeted by the land of Joglikunazmoq, the border state of the border realm of the Triunics. Our troops took everything of value, and what was valueless they burnt down out of spite.\n\nWere the Incursion successful the rest of the lands of the Lake would have met the fate of Joglikunazmoq, but alas we are weak in the aftermath of our invasion. Worse yet, the land is still populated, and those who still live there are more than eager to repay us our actions during the Incursion, and then some. The wretches of the Jolgik Uts smell blood, and are already amassing for their retribution."
 flavour_wild_hunt.16.a: "We must send them tribute and hope it will be enough."
 flavour_wild_hunt.16.b: "Whatever they will manage to raid was trifling anyway."

 flavour_wild_hunt.17.t: "Irdaeos Does not Favor us"
 flavour_wild_hunt.17.d: "The question of how to best honor Irdaeos is a delicate one. Some say that it is done through a life well lived, others seek Irdaeos’ favor through grand rituals, and still others seek unity with Irdaeos through unity with others and their communities. Even within these sects, there are differences of opinion to the degree that any two centaurs will have two different opinions about how entry to the heaven of Ik Magthaal is obtained. This naturally causes a great deal of fighting and debate between the sects.\n\nIf there is any silver lining to the failure of the Incursion, it is that we have done something unprecedented. We have unified all the sects, subsects, and individual practitioners of the land under one belief: our state has failed Irdaeos in every way it is possible to do so, and the reign of the current Caehn is his vengeance."
 flavour_wild_hunt.17.a: "“I’m glad we can all get along."

 flavour_wild_hunt.18.t: "The End is Neigh"
 flavour_wild_hunt.18.d: "Our Caehn has been discovered in his tent with his throat cut. There does not appear to have been signs of struggle, indicating that the Caehn perhaps knew his assailant. His guards have begun compiling a list of suspects, but the issue is that there are simply so many people who might have wanted him dead. The neighboring clans might have wanted to kill him to further fracture our control of our borderlands, so that their clans might switch fealties. The Triunics could have sent an agent to further destabilize one of their hated rivals. It could have been one of our own ordsikar, whose grumbling has grown even louder and more irritating in recent times.\n\nIt might be shorter to instruct the guard to compile a list of all who did not want the Caehn dead than those who did. Regrettably, this probably will not occur to the new Caehn, who is little more than a puppet of the ordsikar and seems likely to prove himself even more incompetent than his predecessor."
 flavour_wild_hunt.18.a: "What shall come of the Caehnate?"

 flavour_wild_hunt.19.t: "The Might of Vengence"
 flavour_wild_hunt.19.d: "The Great Caehn has heard tales of people beyond the plains. Their philosophers have spoken of vengeance. They say that vengeance is like drinking the salt water of the Northern Sea- that it is impossible for vengeance to ever truly quench one’s thirst.\n\nThe Great Caehn has also travelled across the Lake Federation. He has gone from Zabyos’tlar to Bazur Qarshtuluu, and he has seen that on the roads there was not a single league without the mutilated corpse of a Triunic hung upside-down by a tree or post. On occasion, the Caehn’s retinue has passed by some surviving or hiding Triunic, and he has gotten the rare treat of beating the Triunic to death himself in accordance with the privileges of rank. In Bazur Qarshtuluu, the Caehn has seen the piles of books the Triunics have accumulated go up in flames, and he has seen the flames at that pyre and similar pyres all across the Federation be put out by covering the burnt archives with the demolished remains of the Triunics’ houses.\n\nThe Great Caehn has seen the officials of the Lake Federation brought forth to him in chains, stinking of tears and shit. In the aftermath of the conquest, the Great Caehn has assigned an entirely new division of advisors to thinking of new ways to execute these officials, each more painful and humiliating than the last. The advisors have recently come up with the innovation of forcing the officials to drown one another to death in pools of the blood of their own people. Though the logistics will be fearsome, this method of execution shows great promise. The Great Caehn has given the man who thought of it a promotion.\n\nThe Great Caehn has seen great clans of centaurs galloping across the grasslands that once belonged to their enemies, wearing the gold and jewels of the people who once fancied themselves rulers of the lakes. The Great Caehn has migrated with his host across the Lake Federation, and held court in each of their great capitals. The great buildings of stone did not suit the Caehn, who prefers grass under his hooves. The Great Caehn has ordered each of these buildings destroyed after he left them.\n\nOn his travels, the Great Caehn has reflected on the great joy and wealth such Triunic suffering, both what he has seen and what he has not seen, has brought him. The Great Caehn has reflected on his journey of vengeance, and the message of the philosophers from afar. The Great Caehn has come to a conclusion.\n\nThose philosophers were idiots."
 flavour_wild_hunt.19.a: "The Hunt will echo on forever!"

 flavour_wild_hunt.20.t: "We Failed Again"
 flavour_wild_hunt.20.d: "All Hunts end eventually. Some end in success and drunken triumph, once their quarry has been caught. Ours has ended in recrimination and shame. Our quarry was nothing less than dominion of the plains, the lakes, and the lands beyond, and it can be decisively said at this point that we have failed to catch our prize.\n\nExcuses among the advisors abound: the walls of the Triunics were too high, the plains were too disunified, the generals were incompetent- talk to someone else in the court and they will have a different reason absolving them of all mistakes conducted during the campaign. The fact remains, however, that all of these mistakes were committed by someone, and the compounding of their end result is undeniable- the Triunics have slipped the noose again.\n\nOne does not need to be experienced in divination to predict what will happen next. The Triunics, bonded together in the aftermath of our second defeat, will grow even closer. They will politically unify, and expand across the plains. One day, the last hoofbeat of the last centaur will echo out across the plains that Irdaeos gave to his people.\n\nIf there is something positive to be said about this fate, it is that the Wild Hunt will likely not exist to see it."
 flavour_wild_hunt.20.a: "All is lost."

 flavour_wild_hunt.21.t: "Silence in the Steppes"
 flavour_wild_hunt.21.d: "The heart of the plains has been torn out today- after a long and prosperous life, the Caehn of Storms Khaimalk III has died. Although he died surrounded by his children and trusted advisors instead of gloriously on the field of battle, it is hard to imagine that Irdaeos would have anything less than a place in his own clan in Ik Magthaal for his chosen son. It is not the eternal happiness of Khaimalk that the people despair over, but the fate of Wild Hunt without his infinitely righteous guidance after so long spent with it, and the thought of a future without him.\n\nThere is only one thing to do: the realm’s swiftest messengers will be sent to ride day and night across the plains to inform the nation. They will ride faster than they have ever ridden before, for now that our Caehn is dead they carry a piece of his spirit inside them."
 flavour_wild_hunt.21.a: "They ride in his honor."

 flavour_wild_hunt.22.t: "The Call"
 flavour_wild_hunt.22.d: "One of our centaur brothers is in dire trouble, an outsider seeks to claim land in Irdaeo's domain, will the Caehn honor his duty to Centaurkind?"
 flavour_wild_hunt.22.a: "They call, and the Caehn shall answer!."
 flavour_wild_hunt.22.b: "They were never loyal to us anyways."
