 I26_memory_of_what_was_desc:0 "Once more, the whole of the Silent Lake has been returned to our hands - no longer need our people worry about raiders and invaders attacking and razing their vessels, should they dare to go out upon the calm waters of the lake.\nAs our people make ready their boats and rig their sails, our archivists, poets and scribes regale the ancient tales of our ancestors - they remind us of the Great Wander, which our ancestors had undergone many generations ago; they remind us of the parallels between said journey and our own time within the Deepwoods, prior to the Veil's fall.\nThough our people cannot quite fathom the sea our ancestors must have crossed - they cherish the greatest 'sea' within the Deepwoods and celebrate the opportunity to savor its presence once again."

 I26_extinguish_the_flame_desc:0 "Our rangers, having travelled along the lengths of the Silent Lake's rivers and having established a variety of holdings - both along the river and beyond the Deepwoods' tree line - bring word of a most vile landscape; an endless, dreadful mire. In their attempts to begin establishing a presence within the area, they have encountered an equally vile foe - large creatures entirely enveloped in fur, with maws capable of shattering bone; “Gnolls”, as they have been dubbed.\nThese creatures have proven to be a nuisance, raiding our newly established outposts and settlements - this cannot stand; we cannot allow them to impede our taming of this dreadful mire, nor can we allow them to harass our people. They must be dealt with - we shall send experienced and hardened warriors to route these beings, or to hunt them down altogether."

 I26_llif_cyflym_desc:0 "With the return of Gwindeth Camllann from beyond the Deepwoods, we have been graced with the opportunity to expand our understanding of the world - and of new martial arts. Gwindeth has brought with her knowledge of a practice from Ibevar - "Diranbe" or Bladedancing - but she has adjusted it to her own style of combat, one that more closely aligns with the methodology of our own warriors.\nThis new style of combat - known as “Dawnswheí” or Glaivedancing - focuses upon using a glaive as a catalyst for casting magic spells. Gwindeth has begun teaching our people of this art, and many seem to be interested in mastering it - she has even offered to formally educate some of our soldiers in Glaivedancing, so that it may become an integral part of our culture's martial traditions."

 I26_streic_gwir_desc:0 "The Art of Dawnswheí has proven itself not merely beautiful but powerful - it has been tested by the horrors of war, and it has thrived. Gwindeth Camllann's techniques have persevered through the harshest conditions and have been accepted as a noble and lethal craft. Glaivedancing has fully found its roots within our society - many have learned its ways and many more yet yearn to.\nDawnswheí has become more than just a martial art - it has become a cultural phenomenon, one which is represented in all echelons of our society. It is performed as entertainment and practiced as sport - even those of the ruling class have taken a liking to Glaivedancing."

We must make our realm a welcoming place for any of our kin - Wood Elf or otherwise.\nMuch like the elves of the Redglades, who welcomed our people and showed them hospitality, we shall do the same for their people - and those of other elven realms.\n Wood Elves and Moon Elves - with a shared past and common ancestors, we are many cultures, yet a single people."

 I26_moonsinger_desc:0 "At the very edge of the dreadful mire, which we have tamed and settled despite the harsh landscape, our people found something that they had only heard tales of. For a millennium, the only sea that our people had known was that of the Silent Lake - yet now, as they stood at the coastline of the mire, they peered out upon the open ocean - a vast, forest of waves, devoid of trees or foliage.\nMuch like the moon's shine upon the Silent Lake, this sea shimmered in the moonlight - though far more than our humble lake. Those that have visited the coastline have brought back tales of its beauty, and many others have decided to make the pilgrimage to the west, to see it for themselves.\nOur historians and poets have begun regaling the tales of Munas Moonsinger; he who guided the Remnant Fleet - our ancestors - to Cannor and brought an end to the Great Wander.\nWe shall honor the Moonsinger and the Fleet, sing their songs and tell their stories.\nWe shall never forget our past, even if an aeon has passed since then."

 I26_dirwn_gosgeiddig_desc:0 "As our lands have expanded into the Dreadmire and our connections to our distant Cannorian kin have deepened, many of them have come to live among us - both in the Mire and in the Deepwoods itself. Their presence within our communities has become evident, many finding themselves entangled in the social tapestry of our towns - integrating fully into our realm, bringing with them the culture of the Moon Elves, while celebrating and accepting our culture.\nMany of these Moon Elves have similarly found their soulmates among our people - and they have not shied away from pursuing their heart's desire, forming new families that are borne of a union of Moon and Wood.\nThese new families, often endearingly referred to as "Lunarbranch Families", have combined the best aspects of both of our cultures and have ingrained themselves within our realms customs - resulting in a slew of new traditions and celebrations being introduced into our cultural weave."

 I26_the_world_beyond_desc:0 "Though the Veil has recently fallen, it seems that our first major interaction with the outside world would not be a simple excursion out of our woods into the world beyond. Instead, with the return of the contingent that departed to find a distant forest of ruby foliage, we have recently come into contact with the people of said vermilion woodland - the Redglades, as they call their realm.\nAs they have treated our people ever so kindly, and even sent some of their own people along with our contingent, to ensure that they returned to us safely, we have come to learn much of the world - both from the experiences of our contingent, and the tales told by the elves of the Redglades.\nWe have come to learn much of the world beyond our forests, and we have come to realize that there is far more for us yet to learn."

 I26_the_prick_of_the_thorn_desc:0 "The elves of the Thorn Grove, our eastern neighbors - Salla Drennen - have been pushed to the very brink of extinction by the hordes of orcs that washed over our forest like a deluge during the Greentide. They have never been considered one of the strongest Salla, yet they have proven themselves to be exceptionally hardy people.\nDespite being pushed nearly wholly out of their grove, barely holding on to the last sliver of the Thorn Grove, they have held their ground. Unable to take the fight directly to their orcish assailants, they have instead resorted to a defensive strategy; ensuring that any attack levied against them is punished severely - much like how the thorns of weeds prick the hands of those who try to unroot them.\nWith our recent victories over the Forest Goblins, we can now afford to offer our assistance to our kin from Salla Drennen - while they protect their homeland, we can offer them the aid they need to push back and reclaim their lost lands, and we might prove ourselves to be trustworthy allies in the process."

 I26_viridescent_tower_desc:0 "One of the elven heroes that braved the Great Wander with our ancestors, Garion the Wise, was the founder of an association of mages, which calls itself "the Magisterium". This organization, which seems to have embedded itself into the structure of many Cannorian realms, is a font of nigh endless knowledge - much of which we could use to try and unravel the mysteries of the Deepwoods.\nThough much our magical prowess differs in nature from that of the mages in the Empire of Anbennar and its surrounding realms, we may find some use in embracing their practices in exchange for access to their archives and their expertise.\nWe shall offer the Magisterium a place in our realm - invite them to integrate our druids into their organization. Our druids shall become magisters; they shall maintain their own tower, one unlike any the Magisterium has ever seen - a tower of viridescence, woven around a grand tree that reaches into the very sky above the canopies of the forest.\nThe Druid-Magisters shall be the future of our magical expertise, and they shall teach others of our ways."

 I26_a_verdant_crown_desc:0 "The Verdant Pact was the first case of the various Salla truly seeing eye to eye, the first case of the Wood Elves uniting in action — facing their problems as a single force, rather than squabbling clans.\nWith the leadership of our Salla, the Pact has thrived and proven itself to be an overwhelming force against the adversaries of our people. Each victory against the invaders has strengthened the bonds between the Salla, bit by bit forging a bond which has proven to be stronger than iron.\nWhile the Pact began as a mere military alliance between the Salla, it has grown to be far more than that. Our people have come to know one another, to fight alongside one another — and now they no longer see any validity in the disputes that led to the Salla drifting apart in the first place.\nFor the first time in Wood Elven history, our lands are united as one — a Verdant Union, one that requires a fitting ruler and a dignified symbol demonstrating our unity: the Verdant Crown."

The Silent Lake's mild currents and the silver gleam of moonlight reflecting off its surface at night had become the heart of our culture.\nHowever, much like the other groves of our kin, it has been befallen by savage invaders; goblins from beyond the veil - no longer can our people sail upon the Lake's soft waves without worry.\nThese goblins have claimed nearly half of our grove - they have driven us from our home, yet we shan't let this stand.\nOur kin, whether they do so begrudgingly or not, see us as the first among many, yet how can we fashion ourselves the leaders of our kin, if we cannot even maintain control over our home?\nWe must drive these goblins out to whence they came and restore our grove to its idyllic nature - we must reclaim our beloved Silent Lake."

Merely a few days after our last battle against the Brambleskinner Clan of goblins - as we still work to restore our governance over our grove - our kin have already begun to spin tales of our war.\nThe other Salla have begun to tell stories of our warriors - how they sailed across the Silent Lake in the dead of night, departed from their vessels without landing at shore, swam across the waters and ambushed the goblins within their own encampment with ease.\nThese tales, while they would usually be a mere source of pride for our Salla, have become a rallying cry for the other Salla.\nAs they chant our praises, they equally decry the weakness of the goblins and the orcs - they embolden our kin to rise up and defend themselves once more; to fight back against the invaders.\nNot only have we begun taking steps towards proving ourselves as the first among the Salla, but we have also driven our kin to take up arms alongside us."

 I26_struggle_no_more_desc:0 "Unlike many other groves, the Bone Grove - that of Salla Cenág, our kin to the south - has never been wholly freed of goblin presence. While we have enjoyed the lush wilderness around the Silent Lake, those of Salla Cenág have struggled for survival in the harsh conditions of the Bone Grove.\nThese conditions have given way to a philosophy unique to those from the Bone Grove; one which they call "Yfel Cenág" - the Bone Struggle. The elves of Salla Cenág deem existence itself - both that of life or that of concepts and ideas - to be under constant threat; always at risk of being destroyed or forgotten. Therefore, one must fight, with any and all means, for one's right to exist - to survive.\nWe cannot permit our kin to be locked in an eternal struggle, nor shall we sit by idly and watch as they fight for their very being. With our recent victories over the Forest Goblins we have proven that we are capable of bringing the fight to them, and that we are able to bring them to their knees.\nNow, let us absolve our kin of this "Yfel Cenág" and help them to find an existence free of eternal struggle."

As such, it is imperative that we reconnect with them, and assist them in ridding the orcish invaders from their lands. Only once we have secured the Hunter Grove and ensured the safety of our kin can we begin sending our forces into the eastern Deepwoods, finally ridding ourselves of the invading goblins and orcs.\nOnce Salla Fealgearn has been reconnected to the rest of the Salla, our true hunt may begin."

However, the onset of the Greentide has brought an end to said practice, with many of those that have attempted to undertake the journey since the beginning of the Greentide intercepted by orcs and goblins and subsequently slain.\nWith our campaigns against the orcs and goblins having been so fortuitous, we can now divert some of our attention to securing the pathways between our lands and those of the other Salla, so that our people — especially the Elders, many of whom still wish to make the journey to Elynaíle — are able to travel freely."

We were pinned down by relentless attacks on our homeland as the orcs ravaged the Mountain Grove, razing much of it to the ground.\nWhile Salla Myna has broadly been understanding of our situation, aware of the fact that we simply could not offer the aid that we were obligated to provide, it has still put an evident strain upon our relations; even more pointedly, it is a stain upon our people's pride.\nNow that we no longer need to worry about the security of our own grove, we can finally divert our focus to our northern neighbors — we shall send our most experienced warriors to drive out the orcs that dare to attack our kin.\nMuch like the goblins that presumed to try and claim our grove, we shall make these orcs regret their every crime against Salla Myna.

 flavor_salla_elyn.1.d:0 "The Silent Lake has traditionally been one of our greatest resources, offering fresh water, fish and the ability to traverse the grove far faster than by foot - as such, it occupies a central role in our people's culture. Along the Silent Lake's shoreline, a variety of shipwrights can be found, most specializing in the craft of small riverboats; capable of traversing most of the waterways of the Deepwoods, such boats remain highly maneuverable.\n\nAs the Silent Lake has come fully under our control once more - and with further conflicts against goblins and orcs looming overhead - it has become paramount to find and exploit every advantage we can get. Our maritime capabilities are one such advantage; our soldiers have begun practicing and training to be highly capable hybrid combatants, able to hold their own on land and still thrive upon the waterways. Specifically, they have trained to traverse the Deepwoods via our riverboats and disembark directly into the water, from which they make their attacks."

 flavor_salla_elyn.3.d:0 "A millennium has passed since the eyes of the Wood Elves were graced by the dancing waves of the open sea - once lost at sea for a millennium, we were denied its soothing sounds for just as long. The Silent Lake and the waterways of the Deepwoods were long the only point of reference for the concept of a sea, let alone an ocean, amongst our people.\n\nYet as Ranger-Pathfinder Liedir Vyas and her detachment followed one of the waterways out of the Deepwoods, their eyes beheld the very land before them simply cease, giving way to an unending body of water, one which must have been the very ocean that their ancestors had once been lost upon.\n\nDespite being practiced rangers, competent and trusted enough to be sent out to explore the world beyond the forest, nigh all were overwhelmed by the sight of the open sea. The Ranger-Pathfinder stepped forth, still awestruck herself, only to crouch down at the edge of the coast - reaching out with her hand, she let the steady ebb and flow of the waves wash across her digits.\n\nMere hours later, the rangers had established their encampment right along the coastline - for the journey to ferry the news of their discovery back to the Deepwoods would not be short, nor could they bring themselves to so quickly give up sight of the sea.\n\nThe campfire’s kindling crackled and cracked, flames dancing wildly within the confines of the firepit. A handful of rangers sat around the fire, singing somberly the remembered chants of the Fleet - offering their reverence and respect to the Moonsinger, while some instead swam in the cold waters of the bay, enjoying the embrace of the sea under the rising moon. Still others yet stood guard, sure to be relieved by their comrades in time to join the others before night’s end.\n\nThe Ranger-Pathfinder spent most of the evening journalling and sketching, describing the coastline and the open sea to the best of her abilities alongside noting the various details of the journey they’d undergone - especially the path they had taken, so that the coastline may be easily found by any subsequent travellers.\n\nIt did not take long for copies to be made of the Ranger-Pathfinder’s journal, which she had offered to [Root.Monarch.GetName] as her report on the expedition. These copies would find themselves spread around the various archives and libraries of our people as “Vyas’ Way to the Sea”"

 flavor_salla_elyn.4.d:0 "As the Deepwoods have attracted more and more of our Cannorian kin to our groves, they have begun erecting small shrines at the edges of settlements - and larger ones within the forest itself. These shrines - often adorned with wooden carvings depicting an eastward facing bow, or even a sculpture of a cloaked elven woman - are dedicated to one of the Cannorian deities: Falah, their Goddess of the hunt, nature, animals and the wilderness itself.\n\nThe Moon Elves that have devoted themselves to this Goddess have proven to venerate nature in a manner that far surpasses our own pragmatic coexistence with the forests - they seem to value even the hostile facets of the wilderness greatly, both the plantlife and wildlife are granted special care amongst their ranks. By the reports of various communities, it has become commonplace for the devotees of Falah to ensure the health and safety of various animals and act as both horticulturists and arborists. \n\nDespite this, these devotees have also been known to engage in hunting within the Deepwoods, though they have done so in a manner that can only be described as respectful - wasting naught of their prey, nor hunting more than they require. Local communities have embraced this wholly, participating in these hunts themselves - and often hosting grand feasts for a variety of occasions."

The stone has been carved in a manner that leaves a profusion of gaps and holes in the pillars and which, when pummelled by the coastal winds, cause the stone to emanate a soft, somber hum. This ghostly melody is dedicated to Munas himself; a song to venerate his legacy. Chiselled upon each stone is a portion of Munas Moonsinger’s life story, so that any and all visitors may read the tales of the Moonsinger.\n\nThis monument, though it was built to strengthen the bonds between our people and those of the Moon Elves, has become a place of pilgrimage for many elves - even for some Sea Elves. Many from across all of Cannor - and the seas beyond - have made their way to the monument to pay their respects to Munas Moonsinger, honoring him as a most cherished forefather and a deity of the Regent Court."

 flavor_salla_elyn.6.d:0 "Three nights in a row, Farwen had come down to the training grounds to work on her glaivework under the moonlight. Three nights in a row, she had found herself training alongside Artorian, a Moon Elven practitioner of Diranbe from the Redglades who had traveled to the Deepwoods while escorting Duskweaver's expedition back home.\n\nWhile on previous nights they had merely trained alongside one another, making at most a passing remark about the other's form or recommendations for adjustments to their fighting style, they hadn't really interacted much.\n\nHowever, tonight proved to be different.\n\n"Care for a spar?" He asked, stepping away from the pell, which he had been practicing against.\n\nFarwen had been caught somewhat off-guard, though she nonetheless followed-through her strike, adequately maintaining good form. She rested the pommel of the glaive against the ground, turning to face him.\n\n"A spar? What, the two of us? - I suppose we could." Her head canted, studying him for a moment.\n\n"Wonderful! - I shan’t go too hard on you." His words rang out with a taunting jingle; a teasing tone.\n\n"You won't go too hard on me? - I assure you, you couldn't even beat me if I were wearing a blindfold." With a smile gracing her lips, she offered him a similar teasing tone.\n\n"If those words weren't a jest, I'd have to take offense." He snickered in turn, seemingly enjoying the exchange.\n\nThey made their way to the training ground's sparring area, where each of them took up their positions. A brief salute was shared between them, before they enveloped each other in a dance of blades; parrying, sidestepping and striking. Their motions were swift, each of them quite skilled - more than capable with their respective weapons, equally matched opponents.\n\nThe spar dragged on, both of them nigh out of breath - one of them was sure to beat the other, though it would be solely based on whoever succumbed to exhaustion first, should they continue. However, the Bladedancer lowered his blade and stepped back.\n\n"Call it a draw? I fear this spar would continue until one of us can no longer stand." He muttered, catching his breath as best as he could.\n\n"I'd prefer to claim my victory - but it seems we're both exhausted anyways; nothing more to be learned from our duel. A draw, very well."

She pushed herself to her feet and descended into the depths of the celebration, away from the water's edge. She walked past the stage upon which the musicians sat, strumming away at their instruments - inspiring a great many elves to dance together.\n\nShe had no intentions of engaging in dance this night, though it did please her to see how much joy others found in the practice. As she wandered through the festival grounds, she couldn't help but think back to that fateful evening when she had first gazed out over the army camp - right then and there, she had made the decision to get herself involved in the war effort. Now that she could see the fruits of her labor, she knew - deep within her heart - that she had made the correct decision; no regrets weighed her down. Had she not, perhaps her home would never have been liberated - perhaps her people would have been overrun. She dismissed the thought before it could fester.\n\nFarwen made her way to one of the food stands, ordering herself something small to eat.\nShe was, for the first time in a long while, content."

At the heart of the festival grounds lay a small shrine, around which various candles had been lit - a portrait of Farwen Elyn, late heir of the Salla, lay beside the shrine. She had given her life to her people's cause, sacrificed herself to secure this victory.\n\nThose that knew her - family, friends and comrades-in-arms - could not find much enjoyment in the celebration; every moment was tainted by the knowledge of what had been lost, at most offering them some form of catharsis.

I cannot fathom why the Conclave has ordained to forsake the groves of the east, nor why they would refuse to respond to the invaders in full force. I know not what to do, nor can I shake the feeling that I have been intentionally kept from partaking in matters of state, as if I were not yet ready to handle such ordeals.\n\nAt the very least, the Conclave has decided to act in a limited capacity, instead of merely sitting by idly.\n\nNonetheless, I must burden you with the question:\nWhat would you do in my position?\nWould you simply abide being ignored and pushed aside?\nWould you not try to rally to provide support for our eastern kin?\n\nI am wholeheartedly at a loss; your opinions and guidance would mean a lot to me, and undoubtedly assist me in handling this dilemma.\n\nI wish you both the greatest of luck and wellbeing, and await your response eagerly."

She has been tempered by them - every decision she has made, every life lost – whether by her own hand, or by her decisions – has left its mark upon her. Difficult times are known to forge strong leaders and Farwen is certainly no exception to the rule; reclaiming the Deepwoods, one grove at a time, has proven one of the most difficult conflicts the Wood Elves have ever weathered.\n\nWith the groves of the Deepwoods now firmly under the control of our people and the war winding down to a close, the time has come to pass the torch onwards. The next generation of Wood Elves crave their chance to shape their future. Thus, it has come to pass that Farwen will take up the title of Ceanna, leading our people into the next era of Wood Elven history.

How can I claim to be a worthy heir, if I cannot partake in our realm's decisions? In the defense of our people - whether they be from our Salla, or others?"\n\nHer mother stood some feet away, her hands clasped in front of her, as she rested against one of the training grounds' walls.\n\n"Farwen, you have yet much to learn - you are prideful, eager.

In that vein, you must be careful with your actions - and even more so with your words."\n\nFarwen swung her glaive once more, this time somewhat more calculated, her frustration beginning to wane - her training was kicking in - and perhaps, also, she was hearing her mother's sense.\n\n"Yet I am expected to sit by the sidelines - to what end? What lesson am I meant to take from this, other than that father doesn't deem me ready?"\n\nShe huffed, her tone growing hoarse, even cracking faintly between words.\n\n"You must learn to temper your pride, to learn patience.

The orcs and goblins were going to overrun my grove - slaughter my people; I had to save them, so what other choice did I have but to send them east? Your Salla would not help, nor would any others. Ideals are the first thing to die in war, Farwen; surely you know this by now?"\n\n"Ideals die first? You cannot be serious - you sacrificed untold lives, our kin - consigning them to their dooms, and you regret nothing? You chalk all objection to that up to an 'ideal'?"\n\n"An ideal, indeed. What else might it be? Would you expect me to let my people die instead? Have me make a last stand, with no hope of victory? The certainty of death looming over each of my soldiers? - No, I did exactly what I had to do; the lives of others are an ideal, when one fights for one's own survival."\n\n"All of those lives - our people. Three whole Salla annihilated and rendered refugees - by your decisions. How does your soul not weigh heavily? How does it not impair your heart?"\n\n"Because I cannot allow it to - nor should you, Farwen. As the Ceann of my people, it is my responsibility - my duty – to take this weight upon me. It will be yours too, soon enough, and you shall learn, as I have, that to let oneself be weighed down by the decisions that one has to make is to fail in one’s duty. We do what must be done, however ugly it may be."\n\nFarwen stood silently, her voice resting heavily in her throat. Was Oberon right? Was there nothing else to be done?

Pain, suffering and loss - none of these were strangers to her, yet the sheer quantity present within Salla Ayeth was oppressive; nigh suffocating.\n\nA meeting with the Ayeth had been arranged, in honor of the reclamation of the Arrow Grove, yet there was no jubilation, nor any decoration as there had been when Salla Elyn celebrated their own liberation. There were few present: a handful of guards waiting just outside, and within the hall only Ceann Irvah and his son, Elaria, sat at a table.\n\nFour chairs surrounded the table; two were already occupied. Farwen stepped up, offering them both a bow, intending to speak as one would conventionally do, though her voice opted to fail her, catching in her throat. Irvah gestured to one of the open seats and Farwen, wordlessly, took her place at the table. She could not help but glance at the empty seat. It was ornate, rivalling only the design of the seat that Irvah sat upon - a testament to the craftsmanship of the Ayeth. Only as Farwen turned her attention to Irvah, whose gaze dwelled upon the empty chair too, did she realize who would usually have been seated there.\n\n"It was where my soulmate would sit, were she still here with us. Alas, we remain with naught but memories… and the pain they bring." Irvah's tone was deep and raspy.\n\n"I... am sorry for your loss; sorry that we could not come to your aid sooner."

They placed great value on their harmonious existence with the fey - though it didn't do much to protect them from the invaders.\n\nSalla Ghûl, from the southernmost grove - known as the Shadow Grove, relied greatly upon the art of stealth and reconnaissance - to know the weakness of an enemy and to exploit it with great precision formed the foundation of their warfare.\n\nFarwen had seen each of these doctrines employed during the campaign, but one of the Salla's methods had grown on her more than the others."
