    kalyin_harmonize.101.t:0 "Kalyin's Fellflame, Kalyin's Forge"
    kalyin_harmonize.101.d:0 "Few races on Halann are as feared as the gnolls. The stories of Xhazobs and their chosen mortal vessels, the Xhazobines and Xhazobains, have made their way to our shores all the way from the Divenhal and the deserts of Sarhal. Despite all of this, we still sought to understand the face of Kalyin looked upon by the gnolls, and we found an answer in the gnolls who followed the way of Kvanga.\n\nTheir tenets are based on ideas of rebirth, reforging, and reusing what is broken to uncover a greater purpose for it. And was it not through piecing together and reforging the broken shards of reality how prophetess Saragerel saw through the false division and found the truth of Kalyin?\n\nAs for the Xhazobkult, the adherents of Kvangahga offered us a new perspective on the infamous Xhazobs and their followers. According to The One Truth, Kalyin created everything from the plants and animals that sate our hunger to the demons that yearn to burn our world with hellfire. The Kvangahga views Xhazobs as beings who exploited the dormant savagery that lay within gnolls by tempting them with terrifying power, and indeed our faithful have formed our own theories as to why Kalyin made them. The most popular one among the citizens in Yarikhoi is that they are a warning of the dangers found in untempered zeal, while the gnolls who see Kalyin's truth think of them as Kalyin's way of culling the evils of the world by drawing them out to be seen and vanquished.\n\nIn the end, both us and the gnolls have gained much from this new understanding. We saw a face of Kalyin that teaches us to pick ourselves up and better ourselves when we feel broken, and the gnolls have begun to try and learn the truth of the world: not by destroying it with Fellflame and futilely trying to piece it back together afterwards, but by swearing to forge new ways to understand the different faces of Kalyin revealed to all of us."

    kalyin_harmonize.102.t:0 "All are Equal Under The Sun"
    kalyin_harmonize.102.d:0 "Out of all the reflections of Kalyin, few are as close to the truth as the ‘Surael’ of the Jadd. We have therefore chosen to use the Jadd as a kind of baseline to explain Kalyin to our Sun Cult subjects and understand their aspect of Kalyin.\n\nThough confused about the Nature of Kalyin, the Jadd have some of the most important aspects down; they know there is only one god like the other Sun Cults, but unlike those, the Jadd also understands that all sentient beings are equal. Despite this, we have faced some difficulties in fully reconciling the Surael-Aspect – namely, the fundamentalist nature of the Jadd which has made it more difficult to work with than the more tolerant Old and New Sun Cults. It has taken a great while to explain that since Kalyin encompasses everything, other faiths aren’t worshipping her ‘incorrectly’ even if they have an incomplete view of her.\n\nAnother difficult aspect of Bulwari faith to reconcile has been the ‘Malevolent Dark’ and what this concept truly means. The traditional Jadd view is that the Malevolent Dark isn’t a force per se; rather, it represents the corruption of the other Sun Cults. Most Kalyinite theologians however have agreed that its significance goes beyond mere metaphor - its vital importance in the other Sun Cults is a sign that there must be more to it than just an avatar of moral corruption.\n\nTwo broad camps have emerged: one arguing that the Malevolent Dark is an absence of Kalyin, just as darkness is the absence of light, the other that since Kalyin is everything, the Malevolent Dark is also a tool of Kalyin, intended to further our spiritual development. Through debate and discussion, broad answers have been explored that are satisfying to both the general populace and to our Sun Cult converts, even if they do not reach total agreement."

    kalyin_harmonize.103.t:0 "Our Enemies Aspect" 
    kalyin_harmonize.103.d:0 "The centaurs have been the enemies of the Triunic people since time immemorial; thus, though our people know in their head that they’re also children of Kalyin, in their heart there is still hate for them. Still, in order to understand Kalyin we must understand all of her aspects. We initially set out to learn about how the centaurs see Kalyin – but what we found surprised us. Instead of finding Irdaeos, the brutal warlord we expected, we found Irdaeos, the stern but loving father. We found the Irdaeos who adopted the centaurs after they had to flee their homeland, the Irdaeos who only asks that they appreciate what he’s given to them.\n\nWe found out that the centaurs were also not as single-minded as we thought. The Filustkhuga sect is one with which we’re very familiar; seeking to die in battle, they tested themselves against us time and again and caused great devastation, but the centaurs have other ways to honor Irdaeos too. The Maleskhuga sect preaches persevering against all, a trait that can be used for evil or good. The Malukhuga sect praises the wielding of magic - personally distasteful for us, but undeniably also a part of Kalyin. The Irdukhuga sect is focused on enjoying life and not spoiling it with needless conflict – some, slow to let go of our ancestral hostility, dismiss this as hedonistic, but many others feel that it’s the simple pleasures that make life tolerable.\n\nTo the discomfort of our most hardline xenophobes, we’ve learned that the centaurs are not nearly as monstrous as we had assumed. The centaurs, for their part, have begun to appreciate the efforts we’ve made to understand their god and the nuances of his worship - they too have started to see that we’re not so different."

    kalyin_harmonize.104.t:0 "A Scholarly Understanding"
    kalyin_harmonize.104.d:0 "In the past, our people lost sight of Kalyin – they saw incomplete reflections of her and mistook them for gods. It took until our prophetess Saragerel Oqaryezin reassembled the true image of Kalyin that mortals understood her again. We set out to continue her work and so when we came to Cannor we were unsurprised to find shattered reflections: their ‘Corin’, their ‘Kazraiel’, their ‘Adean’, and their ‘Castellos’. Thus we got to work, piecing them back together into the whole of Kalyin. What we didn’t expect was to find another group doing the same.\n\nThrough intense study of the myriad faces of Kalyin, the ‘Ravelian Society’ correctly deduced that they all belonged to one god. Nevertheless, the Ravelians labour under a fundamental misunderstanding of Kalyin. They looked upon the broken reflection of Kalyin and thought that meant Kalyin herself was broken - this has led to them focusing on irrelevancies. They’ve convinced themselves that after Kalyin was shattered, a transplanar paradise called a ‘heaven’ was locked off to mortals, and they have devoted all their energy into opening it up again. They also venerate an artefact in their possession which they believe is the last true shard of Kalyin.\n\nThis can only be nonsense, of course, for Kalyin was never truly shattered, but the Ravelians are not wrong about their artefact’s importance. Even all the way over in Yarikhoi, its power is great enough to detect with the proper instruments; we don’t know why Kalyin created this artefact, but it’s certainly an important part of her plan. Another aspect of Ravelian thought we’ve come to appreciate is their drive to understand the world; as Kalyin is everything, it’s only logical that understanding as much as you can will help you understand Kalyin. With their background, it has proven easier to convince our Ravelian subjects about Kalyin, and their groundwork has helped us understand the reflections of Kalyin in the Cannorian pantheon."

    kalyin_harmonize.105.t:0 "Our Greatest Challenge Yet"
    kalyin_harmonize.105.d:0 "Over Haless, a shadow descended. It called itself the Command, and it became an existential threat to all– less a state and more an army with a civilian apparatus. What makes the folk of the Command so unusual is that they’ve rejected any and all gods, regardless if they exist or not. Integrating these ‘Godlost’ has proved to be exceedingly difficult; with other people we could find how their gods related to the greater whole of Kalyin, but even if these Godlost had accepted the existence of Kalyin, they would still have rejected her. We needed to dig deeper: if we couldn’t understand these people, we'd never be able to truly bring them into Kalyin's embrace.\n\nAfter looking, we found the reason, and it is in their past. They too suffered under the hand of mages, though theirs justified their atrocities through the gods, hardening the hearts of their people to the divine. Then the first Harimari, Harimar, forced them from their ancestral homes, just like the centaurs did to our ancestors. Then there was the Day of Ashen Skies. All these tragedies made them lose faith in the gods, but without the struggle we would never grow. Without the bitter, we would never know sweet.\n\nMany of our Godlost subjects closed themselves off the moment they heard we worshipped a god; we needed an intermediary and found one in the organization called the Gommo. Their philosophy is called ‘The Thought’ and seeks to understand Kalyin as we do, though strictly in the sense of studying reality. They were pleasantly surprised when we told them of the One Truth, Kalyin essentially being everything, and our mission in studying all gods and faiths to understand all existence. They agreed to serve as our intermediaries and give our answers to the Godlost’s questions; even more fortunately, the gnomes proved excellent debaters. After many years of rigour we’ve finally managed to reconcile Kalyin with a disbelief in higher powers."

    kalyin_harmonize.106.t:0 "An Insatiable Appetite"
    kalyin_harmonize.106.d:0 "The Ogres’ hunger is boundless. It’s easy to see them as monsters, when they’re so willing to eat other sentient beings, even others of their own kind. It’s disquieting to think how anyone could justify such brutality, but the hunger is part of this world and therefore part of Kalyin –we’ll never fully know her if we don’t understand them. So we set to work; we tried our best to truly understand, and now we feel we do. The ogres see consuming others as a way to gain power, by consuming others, they believe they became as gods. We’ve been forced to acknowledge that there’s some truth to that… a primal truth.\n\nIn this world, all things must consume in order to live – even plants consume energy from the sun. Whenever we eat, we cut short a living thing's life to prolong our own – we take its power for our own. In a sense the Ogre’s experience is a more extreme version of what every living creature feels, for our hungers too can never truly be satiated. Hunger is not even the only obsession; in the north there are ogre-like peoples called trolls. These trolls worship the gods the ogres ate and await for their return, even now when it’s clear they never will. There is another way we’ve been shown. In a reclusive valley, there is another group of ogres who feel the hunger just as strongly, but choose to resist it. With the techniques we’ve learned from these ogres, we’ve seen that all of our obsessions and urges can be mastered, not just hunger. We believe we’ve understood what Kalyin wanted to teach us with the Ogres; we all hunger for something, but if all we do is consume, we will only consume ourselves."

    kalyin_harmonize.107.t:0 "Honor thy Father and Mother"
    kalyin_harmonize.107.d:0 "The dwarves are a people slow to change. Their traditions can sometimes go back further than even their well-kept records. Thus, to understand them we’ve had to bridge one of their greatest schisms. A great many of them don’t worship their gods, choosing instead to venerate their ancestors; bridging this gap, some believe one or more of their gods is also an ancestor. Even those who worship their gods still respect their ancestors to some degree.\n\nIt seems that Kalyin wants us to learn the importance of tradition. The past is our foundation, the very ground the present stands on. For those dwarves venerating their ancestors, we presented Kalyin not as a god, but as all things. As all things she is also every ancestor and every ancestor’s ancestor. We had to answer a very important question, however – if the dwarven gods are a reflection of Kalyin, does that mean that Kalyin abandoned Aul Dwarov? We’d say no; we reject the idea that the fall of Aul-Dwarov was an abandonment by the gods at all.\n\nThe Dwarves kept very good records, and so we know Aul Dwarov had many issues. It was internal conflict that brought down Aul Dwarov; the orcs only dealt the final blow. Saving Aul Dwarov from its inhabitants' own decisions would have undermined their freedom – after all, does a choice really matter if it doesn’t have consequences?\n\nImportant here is the Second Praxis, that everything is a part of Kalyin. If the dwarves were to reject Kalyin as a unifying truth behind their fractal gods, they’d have to also reject their ancestors, themselves too part of Kalyin. The pantheon worshippers have been tirelessly working to reconstruct how their gods were worshipped. With how little they know about their lost gods, they are already more open to changing their perspectives based on new evidence– evidence we have now provided them with. In essence, they’ve already started working on our goal of understanding the dwarven gods, and we’re more than happy to encourage them."

    kalyin_harmonize.108.t:0 "A Reminder Of What Was"
    kalyin_harmonize.108.d:0 "For hundreds of years, we saw Kalyin as three separate beings – the mother Yukel with her children Kodave and Enuuk. It was only relatively recently that we realized we were merely worshipping three different faces of the same divine being. Their unity has become the symbol of our faith, but we know in our hearts Kalyin has many more reflections for Her children to learn from. The most recent reflection we found was wearing the face of a large cat-being.\n\nThe kingdom of Kheterata has existed for thousands of years. Though it has been occupied and conquered many times, their gods and their creations, the Khet, have always remained a subject of worship. In the long history of the kingdom, three faces have become subjects of worship: Nirakhet, the weeping mother; Elikhet, the founder and architect; and Aakhet, the great conqueror. While all Khetists agree the Khet are of great importance due to their connection with the divine, there are major disagreements over theological particularities between the sects. Some consider Elikhet himself as primarily worthy of worship, while others prefer to direct their prayers to his mother Nirakhet, and only the Aakhetists consider Aakhet as something more than a hero-king of times long past. Our theologians reached an epiphany while attempting to explain the One Truth to them: theirs is a mirror image of our history. They see three different aspects of the same truth and focus on one over the rest.\n\nRealizing this, the theologians went on to study the long history of Kheterata. The lessons of a kingdom 4000 years old. The wisdom of a people caught in a constant cycle of subjugation, occupation, and liberation. How they have kept their faith through the conquests of the first Great Xhaz, the Damerians, and the Crodamics. It was these lessons that gave us the key to touching the hearts and minds of its people.\n\nWe likened their loving mother ‘Nirakhet’, their creator and architect ‘Elikhet’, and their warmaster ‘Aakhet’ to our Yukel, our Enuuk, and our Kodave. We told the Khetists how each of them saved us from would-be conquerors just as their gods saved them. That all of them are mere facets of the same divinity, the same God. That each Khet was not just made by, but also is a part of Her. That as we learned of the true nature of our gods, so should they."

    kalyin_harmonize.109.d:0 "Kalyin created everything and is everything, nothing is outside of her. This is the One Truth and it has always been our goal to seek out every reflection of Kalyin on Halann. During our search, we have encountered many new races and many different beliefs, one of which is something known simply as ‘The Hunt’.\n\nMainly practiced by the harpies, most would consider it a philosophy rather than a religion. Regardless of what its true nature might be, we decided to try and see what Kalyin wanted to teach us when inspiring the harpies to develop the Hunt, and we discovered a lesson that would forever aid our mission.\n\nAccording to the harpy philosopher Nehijunus, “The Hunt is nothing more than the way harpies live; nothing less than looking clearly at the world.”\n\nThe Hunt also knows a principle called “mantalqo” which roughly translates to ‘flying above without resistance’ which encourages syncretism with other faiths in search of answers to an individual’s questions. With this principle in mind, it is quite possible that the key to finding and understanding Kalyin’s many different faces might be to simply take a step back and face Her with a clear mind and untroubled heart.\n\nWe should also remember that the hunter is not alone and serving only themself. We are part of a greater community and all work together in pursuit of a shared goal. We all serve the greatest possible purpose: The hunt for Kalyin."
